2007 Nissan 350z - Very nice and Very clean - PRICE REDUCED
"This car has been a real gem for me. The reason that I am selling is so i can save up for a nice truck. This is a second car for me so I am in no rush to sell. 
So..
---It's a 2007 Nissan 350z, which was a big change in the Z world.
These came with the anniversary wheels, bigger headlight lenses, led taillights, updated interior, but best of all, a big improvement in the engine! bumped it around 30 horses from previous years.
---This is the touring edition so that includes the 18"" wheels, the heated leather seats, bose stereo system and a few other things.
---I have always kept her very clean and taken care of all maintenance religiously. I have all records since the car was bought brand new (even the window sticker) I am only the second owner!
---Just rolled over 90k miles and got new clutch and pressure plate, transmission fluid, differential fluid, oil, air intake filters, spark plugs and a tank of gas! lol
---These cars are so much fun to drive but also very comfortable for long drives, Just put the Michelin sport tires on not too long ago and have great tread left, I have an aftermarket stereo in with bluetooth, also has a custom subwoofer (which I have not carpeted yet)
***I also have a set of lowering springs that when installed will leave no wheel gap***

I am asking only 13000 but considering all offers so just text me, email me, or call anytime.
Thanks for looking

"*****FARM/RANCH HELP**** (Jasper, canton, waleska area)"
"I am 16 years old and am looking for a part time job as a Farm Hand. I can cut grass, weed eat, and most other basic landscaping skills. I also can feed/water horses, clean stalls, any barn work. I also will ride and work any horses. VERY experienced in riding horses. YOU HAVE ANY FARM WORK? I CAN DO IT! I can drive myself to and from job. Email me for anymore details or if you are interested."
Looking for a horseback riding instructor? (Roswell)
"Are you looking for a reliable Horseback riding instructor? 
I have been teaching riding lessons for 5 years now, but previously I have shown across the nation in multiple Hunter/Jumper associations. I can show you everything from the ground up, beginner to advanced riders. Hunter/Jumper's is not all that I can do, I have a great reputation in the Saddleseat, western pleasure, Eventing and in the Barrel Racing worlds. I have also managed multiple barns from Atlanta, GA to Miami, FL. I have a very flexible schedule, and can work with you through any tasks that you are trying to complete with your equine partner. I do not have a barn, so I am able to travel to your barn if you have a proper riding arena. I am able to cover the Roswell, Alpharetta, Milton, Woodstock, Kennesaw surrounding areas. We can discuss location more over the phone! 

Do you need someone to exercise, break or freshen up your horse(s)? Then I am also capable of those tasks as well. I have trained too many horses to count from halter breaking to being the first one on their back. I do not do any Clinton Anderson training, or anything like that. You tell me what you want done, and the job will be completed the correct way! Let's make your horse a super star! 

I also child-proof horses, which means that I come in and train horses to be suitable for a lesson program with children.


I have many different packages that you can sign up for that will not drain out your pocket! 
So give me an e-mail today, and let's get to work!

I am located in the Pan Handle of Florida East Pensacola and North of Destin Just off Interstate 10. Drive a little save a lot.
 
Popular questions:

Why are your panels so cheap compared to everyone else?
I buy a truck load at the time and deal in large volume (over a thousand panels per year). I have a minimal mark up, but sell a bunch of them.

Can I put them in a Pick Up Truck?
Not easily. It is possible without a tool box or bed topper, but it is pretty difficut, and you really risk messing up your bed. Almost everyone gets them in a trailer. Horse trailer, car hauler, utility trailer, etc. Also, bring plenty of straps or rope.

How much does each panel weigh?
They are light enough for one person to handle, about 40-50 pounds each, but it is easier with 2 people to carry them around.

What gauge steel are they?
They are 18 - 20 gauge steel.

Are they galvanized?
No, they are painted.

Do you give a discount if I buy more than one?
Sorry, no. That is as cheap as I can sell them. Most people buy between 12-30 panels. It is hard to do anything with one panel by itself.

Can my horse or cow tear them up?
They are pretty sturdy, but if a horse kicks the panel it will dent where he kicks it. Most horses and cows respect a 5 ft tall fence and don't challenge it. However, if they do jump up on top of it some how, it will bend. Cows are worse than horses to try that. 

Do you sell any other colors or anything else?
Nope, I only sell black panels.

"Paint Pony--gelding 9 yr. old - $450 (Athens, Ga)"
"Paint Pony--gelding. Approximately 9 yrs. old, 11 hands, stocky, good feet. Pony is broke to ride but should be ridden by a child with previous riding experience in that this pony has not been ridden that much in the last year. I purchased this pony from Cleveland Rd., Athens about three years ago. It was used in a fall festival on that road (corn maze or pumpkin patch--I forgot exact name) for pony rides under saddle. The girl on my farm that rode him occasionally has moved and that is my reason for selling him. He is a very nice pony with a wonderful disposition. He gets along very well with other horses. Price is $450 firm, the same price I paid for him. No horse traders please and I don't need help selling.

Registered Tennessee Walking Horse TWH
"I have a 15 year old Registered TWH gelding that I would like to TRADE ONLY. 

Gelding around 14.3 hands, black and has a motor. He would make a great endurance horse or for someone who likes to move on out on the trails. He does not care if he is riding with other horses or not. He has been extensively shown and has just recently became a trail horse. He is loving the trails and is not spooky at all! Nothing has bothered him on the trails deer, tents, people, dogs, etc he has not spooked at anything. He will cross whatever you put in front of him without question and loves water. He is a fantastic trail leader and likes to move on out across fields. Very smooth. I currently have him barefoot but he is tender on gravel type rocks. So he will need front shoes for heavier riding. He is not for a beginner because of his motor. He is dominant at feeding time but if fed first he is okay. He loads easy on a 2 horse straight load and bigger trailers, he is easy to catch and likes to be groomed and get attention. He is not up to date at the time but I can have him done if trade horse is up to date. He is completely sound, healthy and ready to ride. I cant send link to his bloodlines and pictures in email. 

What I am looking for:
17 years or younger Palomino or Grey gaited horse preferably a gelding will consider a mare but do not want the mare attitude. Looking for something that is calm and safe. Nothing spooky, that bucks/rears or bolts. Looking for a horse with **less of a motor** but one that will rack when asked. Nothing that trots please!!! No soundness issues. Does not have to be registered.

STANDING AT STUD: FOUNDATION BRED AQHA PALOMINO-DRIFTWOOD LINES - $400 (Cumming)
"Standing at stud for the 2015 breeding season:

SV Treye Bars King is a gorgeous, golden palomino stallion with the look and breeding of a classic, foundation Quarter Horse. You won't find too many like this one. He is something special. King has very correct, beautiful conformation and a friendly, kind disposition that he passes onto his offspring. Countless people have remarked on how well mannered and docile this boy is; they can't believe that he is a stud! He loves being with people and will come right up to you in the pasture. He has a lot of presence and is built like a tank, with a broad, powerful chest, muscular neck, short back and straight legs. He has nice movement as well, and is very fast and agile.

King's offspring possess beauty, speed, agility and a good mind. His offspring show talent and are being used in the show/competition arenas as well as all around using horses. Put color and class into your foal! He also has very sought after, valuable foundation bloodlines with no modern halter or Impressive lines. He has classic, cow horse foundation breeding all the way. His pedigree traces back to King, Poco Bueno, Wimpy, Three Bars, Trey Bars, Ruano Rojo, Blue Valentine, Joe Reed II, Moon Deck (by Top Deck), Orphan Drift, Driftwood Ike (by Driftwood) and Plaudit (1898 Kentucky Derby winner.), among others. You won't find a better foundation pedigree than this, especially with the rare, highly sought after Driftwood lines. 

 Live cover/pasture breeding only. Live foal guarantee. Multiple mare discounts. King is also approved for breeding to APHA mares, with resulting foal eligible for APHA registration. Your mare will receive the best of care. Our facility includes stalls and separate fenced pastures/paddocks. We offer mare care at $7.00 per day. Contact for more info.

The last 9 pics are of his offspring. As you can see, this is a stallion that stamps quality onto his foals. We are expecting a few foals next year as well! Visit our website for more pics and info on our horses: svfarms.weebly.com"

"****PRICE INCLUDED 60 MONTHS 100,000 MILES POWERTRAIN WARRANTY****
(call for details)


Our 328i puts an emphasis on one thing: Sporty driving dynamics that appeal to enthusiast drivers. It accelerates, turns and stops with remarkable agility and balance, without seriously compromising comfort or common sense. Power for our 328i comes from a 3.0-liter inline six that produces 230 horses and still offers nearly 30 mpg on the highway

This BMW offers you gizmos you'd expect in larger, full-on luxury sedans. Our 328i features the electronic wizardry that has become BMW's stock-in-trade over the last decade, including one of the auto industry's most complex stability-control systems. 

Sporty driving and a plethora of features give you the perfect combination for a great car.

"137 acres of land for sale in Jasper - only $5,850 per acre! - $5850 (Jasper)"
"If you are looking for the ideal location for a mountain home, with privacy, streams, and a mountain view, then this is your location. No existing home on site, but has access to water and electricity. Land has plenty of pasture and is fully fenced should you want to raise cattle or horses. Paved road access with property on both sides of paved road. Just 15 minutes from downtown Jasper.

Not many opportunities like this exist. There is 25 acres on one side of the paved road and 110+ acres on the other side. Both sides are fully fenced and have plenty of pasture for a working farm. Pasture was recently bush hogged and looks beautiful. Perfect for peace and quiet, with deer and wild turkey on the property, it's a sportsman's paradise. This property isn't steep sloping and full of trees that you see in other ads. Plenty of flat level land for your dream home, or even invest for future residential development. 

Serious parties call me @ six seven eight 951-4307. Ask for Jason ... I am the owner. Price is $5,850 per acre, or a total of $801,450. Please don't ask if I'm willing to divide property, lease, or trade. If you are truly interested in the land, and have the financing, please call or email and I can provide more info and pictures. 

Thanks.

Heating and Air Conditioner work great.

We installed nice kitchen cabinets, sink, dorm fridge/freezer, microwave and nice flooring. These will remain with the trailer.  We also have curtains that we can quickly hang up in the back to make the area private when camping.   

The pictures show how we set up the tack area in the back for a cowboy shower including hot water and a teak wood floor and Thetford curve potti.  The shower setup, hot water tank  and Thetford curve can be negotiated or we will keep them.  We have the saddle racks that attach in the tack area that will remain with the trailer.

This is a good trailer that we camped in all over the South East showing our miniature horses.  We upgraded to a larger living quarters is the only reason we are selling.

Will consider partial trade for a 2 or 3 horse Bumper Pull or a Bumper Pull already converted to haul miniature horses.

WANTING TO RENT/LEASE PASTURE
"West Ga Area: Villa Rica, Winston, Roopville, Douglasville, Carrollton, Temple, Mount Zion, Lithia Springs, (you can always ask if it's close enough I will definitely let you know)

I own horses and I am looking to lease one or two more pastures to be able to put a couple of horses on up to 4 at a time. Two at the minimum. I already have a pasture leased for 12 months that is 6 acres but looking for another lease. If it's more than 6 acres then it will sustain more than four horse at a time but I think logically about it. Please understand I AM NOT GOING TO PAY PER HORSE as I provide ALL CARE, LAND UP KEEP (WITHIN REASON) and I don't bother anyone or cause issues. I take care of my horses and they are all healthy  (UNLESS JUST RESCUED) otherwise they are great in weight and very loveable.  I am 100% up front with you, and I please ask that you be the same way with me. Do have references but currently looking to put two older geldings on the lease that I am contacted about. I just obtained ownership of these two and with my current lease only being 6 acres I only want 4 on the lease at most 5, and I have 6 on there right now. So please SERIOUS PEOPLE ONLY and I look forward to hearing about your land and meeting with you!"

"Wintec 500 JUN CAIR 15 inch all purpose saddle, stirrups and irons - $450 (Buford)"
"New WINTEC 500 Junior CAIR ALL Purpose Deep Black saddle.  Stirrups and irons included.  Has interchangable Gullet system to change fit for different horses if needed but I have misplaced the additional gullets.  These can be purchased seperately at tack stores for $25.00 if I cannot find by sale.  This saddle used very few times.  Maintained very well in a climate controlled atmosphere.  Used on a AQHA QH and a Warm Blood.  Fit nicely.  Daughter moved to Hunter/Jumper and does not need Dressage saddle and will outgrow before she needs again.  I have English riegns/Bridle too match if interested.
The Wintec 500 All-Purpose Saddle with Flocked Panel is a great value! A medium-deep seat and a shaped, padded flap put the rider in a comfortably balanced position. Ergonomic stirrup bars and Equigrip panel create a close contact feel. Drop panel points, a wide channel and Flexiblocs encourage a better fit and provide a more secure feeling for the rider."

Have to review warranty info.  I believe the engine was installed a 260,000.  I purchased this truck for my daughter from a long time friend.  He purchased the truck new in 02. We are the second owner.  The reason for selling the truck is we need to upgrade to a diesel truck for trailering her horses.  The truck has been great since we purchased it.  We have completed some additional maintenance and have all service records as to what we did as preventive maintenance.  While a great truck given the number of horses we tow its just not quite suiting our needs.  The vehicle has been dealership serviced since it was new.  All routine maintenance has been completed and vehicle is driven daily.  New Tires, New Shocks, New Headlights, Fog Lights, and Intake, also replace intercooler, motor mounts, and Full synthetic on all fluids. New Double Din Radio and Speakers w/ Nav, Bluetooth, XM, back up Cam and IPod.  GM warranty on the engine is transferrable to the next owner.  Feel free to ask questions."

Heartbroken, but just can't spend the time with them that they deserve. They're fat, happy, and beautiful in the pasture, but can do so much more than stand around and wait for us to come out and give them a job to do.

Hercules - 15 years old, my personal horse of 4 years and was a show horse out of Buford, GA for all of his life prior to coming to me. Willing personality, great manners, and big motor (fun to ride, easy to handle, is ready to 'go' on queue, but never stupid) 15 yr. old

Also have Cheyenne, a pseudo-retired, 28 year old QH mare. She is still used every summer for a friend's horse camp is does a great job. She's extremely laid back, but push button easy and will do what you ask -  better than almost any other old horse could do. She has started losing sight in one eye this summer, but still seems to navigate just fine. FREE to a GOOD home -  in need of retirement pasture.

Thanks for looking.

PRESTIGIOUS RUSTIC - DOG KENNEL PANELS - DOG KENNELS - DOG KENNEL KITS - $125 (METRO ATLANTA)
"**CUSTOM - HEAVY DUTY DOG KENNELS**

●For the customer with a prestigious, unique or rustic taste.
●For the customer who needs HEAVY DUTY/DURABLE kennel facilities.

$125 PER PANEL, DISCOUNTS PROVIDED when multiple run kits are purchased. The single run Kit displayed in the pictures, is listed at $499.

Each kennel panel is 6ft high by 8ft long / 8'L X 6'h, framed and planked with all pressure treated lumber. Each kennel panel utilizes a galvanized steel, welded one piece wire construction at the top. The welded wire is virtually maintenance free, sag resistant with no stretching. The 11 line wires (horizontal) are 5 gauge, the stay wires (vertical) are 4 gauge and are spaced 8 in. apart. COMPARE THIS, to the gauge of other ""HEAVY DUTY/COMMERCIAL"" welded wire or chain link kennels. These cannot be pulled apart, chewed through or rammed through.

Each kennel panel has a planked bottom to create privacy for your dog. If utilizing multiple dog runs to house several dogs, it prevents fighting/biting through the panel. Unlike other dog kennel panels made from chain link or welded wire. The pressure treated - planked construction eliminates the ""RUST THROUGH AFFECT"" caused by male dog's who urinate on the panels. 

Each panel is framed/fastened/constructed with SCREWS only. Each panel has 3 inches of ground clearance for performing kennel maintenance, when rinsing out the kennel. Above I have posted pictures of an 8'x8' kennel kit. This kit comes with 3- side panels, 1- door panel and is priced at $499.

8'x8' metal covered roof panels and 8'x'8 wood planked floor panels can be added for an additional cost. Wood planked floor panels can be painted with concrete deck over finish, to create a sterilized environment when cleaned. 

I can provide any size kennel kit you desire, however 8'Lx6'H panels are the most economical panel to purchase. I can provide multiple run kennel kits and double door panels, if needed for smaller dimensional kits such as 4'x8' kennel runs. I can also provide solid planked divider walls if needed.

I created this design for my personal use after spending THOUSANDS on other ""SUPPOSED COMMERCIAL GRADE"" chain link and welded wire kennels. Kennels that ended up rusting through and failing within 2 to 3 years of use. 

I am located in Paulding County of Metro Atlanta. I can also meet 5 days per week in Kennesaw of Cobb County. Delivery and installation are available at an additional charge.

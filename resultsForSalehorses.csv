"3 Oldenburg horses for sale (Lakewood,WI)"
"I have 3 Oldenburg horses for sale. All were 1st place premium foals and all are branded. One mare and gelding are Frohwind bred. The other gelding is out of a stallion in CA that was owned by Danny DeVito's sister. These horses have been on my farm for 11 yrs. The are handled daily and are healthy. I'm trying to place them for the owners who have run into some very bad health and financial problems. I don't have their paper and I don't know if anymore info can be found out about them. The oldest(20 yrs old) gelding is 17.hh and was a very good show horse in jumping and dressage. He hasn't been ridden in 11 yrs. The Mare(15-16 yrs old) is a beautiful mover and very good minded. She is 16.3hh and very correct. She was worked under saddle when she was 3. The younger gelding is absolutely gorgouse  he is 13-14 yrs old and 16.3. He has never been saddle broke. I'm not sure what they are worth but I would like to see them go to a good home. Contact me with any offers

The other gelding is out of a stallion in CA that was owned by Danny DeVito's sister. These horses have been on my farm for 11 yrs. The are handled daily and are healthy. I'm trying to place them for the owners who have run into some very bad health and financial problems. I don't have their paper and I don't know if anymore info can be found out about them. The oldest(20 yrs old) gelding is 17.hh and was a very good show horse in jumping and dressage. He hasn't been ridden in 11 yrs. The Mare(15-16 yrs old) is a beautiful mover and very good minded. She is 16.3hh and very correct. She was worked under saddle when she was 3. The younger gelding is absolutely gorgouse  he is 13-14 yrs old and 16.3. He has never been saddle broke. I'm not sure what they are worth but I would like to see them go to a good home. Contact me with any offers

 Thank you Mitzer. PS I'm not English rider I'm just trying to help out these people and horses."

Medieval Times
Knights in shining armor. White horses. Fair maidens. All the magnificent trappings of a bygone era come to life at Medieval Times, where ironclad knights clash for the title of King's Champion in front of a wide-eyed audience that peppers the battlefield with cheers and jeers between bites of a four-course dinner. Each two-hour tournament channels the pageantry and spectacle of 11th-century Spain, pitting six competitors against each other inside a spacious, sand-filled arena for the honor of earning the title of champion and the favor of the royal court. A spirited musical score infuses epic onslaughts with an extra dose of tension as adversaries joust atop stallions, deflect ferocious blows, and slice through suits forged of authentic junk mail. To further immerse guests in the fairy tale, Medieval Times encourages each guest to declare their allegiance by cheering loudly for the knight in their corner.

Like royal guests centuries ago, spectators bask in the revelry while feasting upon a finger-friendly bill of fare without the aid of utensils or the ""choo-choo"" sounds of parents. The four-course feast includes a tomato-bisque soup starter, oven-roasted chicken with a garlic-bread side, single spare rib, and an herb-basted potato. Servers periodically fill patrons' goblets with soda or water, which adults can supplement with purchases from a full-service bar. Meals conclude with the castle's sweet pastry dessert."

Winter Is A Great Time To Re-Mineralize Your Garden Beds - $25 (Chicago)
"Winter is an excellent time to re-mineralize your outdoor edible and decorative garden beds. Andesite can be applied as a top-dress and the snow/rain through the Winter and early Spring months will help naturally work the Andesite into the soil for the upcoming season. 

The human body needs at least 45 - 60 different minerals for optimal health. However, on average only 8 minerals are available in any kind of quantity in most of the food we eat today. If you are growing your own food, there is something you can do about it. Our Andesite Mineral Complex is a 100% natural, biodynamic soil conditioner (straight from Mother Earth) that contains essential and beneficial minerals and trace elements to help your plants (as well as the microbiology in your soil) thrive while increasing the plant's nutrient density in the process.

Nature has been re-mineralizing the soils of the earth through volcanic eruptions and sedimentation since the beginning of time. However, these valuable minerals have been significantly depleted in most soils over the years -- and plant life, soil health and bio-diversity have suffered as a result. Today's soils contain no more than 16-20 minerals on average compared to 80-100 millions of years ago. Without these natural minerals, plants become weaker, require more water, produce less and are more susceptible to stresses, pest infestation and other issues.

In a December, 2011 Healthkeepers Magazine article, Dr. John Apsley (who has studied the effects of soil re-mineralization for decades) stated ""The lack of minerals in our soils, common to the practice of commercial farming, can only produce nutrient-deprived, calorie rich foods, which are low in proteins and high in cheap carbohydrates. This produces and insatiable hidden hunger and underlies the fundamental causation to chronic degenerative disease and premature aging"".

Andesite can be added to the hole while planting/transplanting, mixed in with the soil or applied as a top dress to existing areas and is safe for use on all indoor and outdoor organic vegetables, fruits, decorative plants and flowers, trees, shrubs, lawns and more.

Winter Is A Great Time To Re-Mineralize Your Garden Beds - $25 (Chicago)
"Winter is an excellent time to re-mineralize your outdoor edible and decorative garden beds. Andesite can be applied as a top-dress and the snow/rain through the Winter and early Spring months will help naturally work the Andesite into the soil for the upcoming season. 

The human body needs at least 45 - 60 different minerals for optimal health. However, on average only 8 minerals are available in any kind of quantity in most of the food we eat today. If you are growing your own food, there is something you can do about it. Our Andesite Mineral Complex is a 100% natural, biodynamic soil conditioner (straight from Mother Earth) that contains essential and beneficial minerals and trace elements to help your plants (as well as the microbiology in your soil) thrive while increasing the plant's nutrient density in the process.

Nature has been re-mineralizing the soils of the earth through volcanic eruptions and sedimentation since the beginning of time. However, these valuable minerals have been significantly depleted in most soils over the years -- and plant life, soil health and bio-diversity have suffered as a result. Today's soils contain no more than 16-20 minerals on average compared to 80-100 millions of years ago. Without these natural minerals, plants become weaker, require more water, produce less and are more susceptible to stresses, pest infestation and other issues.

In a December, 2011 Healthkeepers Magazine article, Dr. John Apsley (who has studied the effects of soil re-mineralization for decades) stated ""The lack of minerals in our soils, common to the practice of commercial farming, can only produce nutrient-deprived, calorie rich foods, which are low in proteins and high in cheap carbohydrates. This produces and insatiable hidden hunger and underlies the fundamental causation to chronic degenerative disease and premature aging"".

1993 MUSTANG GT W/NITROUS...ONLY 74k - $7500 (Mchenry)
"1993 MUSTANG GT FOX BODY MUSTANG WITH NITROUS ...ONLY 74k original miles (see details below)!!!

 The specs and information contained here are what was given to me by the previous owner, who did the majority of the work on it. The pictures really don't do it justice, this 'stang is a real head turner.

under 74000 on the car, and about 24000 on the motor.

I'm not sure on the horses or torque 'cause I never had a dyno run on it, but it will definitely put you back in your seat. It runs fine on 92 octane but loves turbo blue 106. If you want to run the nitrous you'll need about $10 worth of pipe fittings and about 30 minutes to complete the system install, besides having the bottle filled and I have no idea what that costs (nitrous hasn't been run on car)

       

HERE IS A VIDEO OF THE CAR STARTING AND RUNNING: 

 http://youtu.be/kVyzAJ5XG94

 I will answer any questions that I can, and I encourage local, personal inspection. Send me a message and we can set an appointment.

Beautiful Solid Cast Copper Folk Art Pine Trees - $80 (pilsen)
"The only two of their kind, these are truly ""folk art"" pieces that were cast from solid copper in approx. 1935 by my grandfather & gentleman farmer Willard A. Hance of Freeport, IL  to impress his father, Willard A. Hance who held many patents for light manufacturing inventions and sat on the board of Freeport's Stover Manufacturing Company.

The mold for this cast was crafted by hand and these are the only two known pieces made from that mold.  The solid copper was melted and poured using the same equipment that my grandfather used to keep his horses' shoes in working condition.  They have been hand-polished to a brilliant finish and not lacquered, and measure 13"" x 9""

These locally crafted folk art pieces will surely be a conversation starter as part of your holiday decorations.

Prefer to sell as a pair.

"Bob Baffert Autographed, Authenticated Horseracing Hall of Fame Jersey - $500 (alta vista/grace)"
"Know a hard to buy for horselover? Certain names are known world-wide; Secretariat, Seabiscuit, and the legendary Silver Fox himself, Mr. Bob Baffert. Trainer of Derby winners War Emblem, Silver Charm and Thunder Gulch, not to mention numerous other great horses including Bodemeister and Point Given, this icon of American Thoroughbred Racing and multiple Eclipse Award winner was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009. Bob currently trains not only the VERY promising American Pharoah, but the early 2015 Kentucky Derby favorite, Dortmund.
I was privileged to obtain this priceless piece of racing memorabilia in a fund-raising auction, it is truly beautiful with blue and gold embroidery on white. It could be mounted in a frame or would be the perfect gift for a young rider as it is ""jockey-size.""  Pictures will be posted or sent upon request. Proof of provenance included."

17 piece Japanese Tea Set circa '60's (Tinley Park)
"About Somayaki: Somayaki (Soma ware) is characterized by the blue-green crackling that covers the surface. An apple ash and sumi-kannyu (crackle) glaze is used to achieve this effect. Somaware is known for its double-walled construction. The inner and outer pieces are thrown separately by the potter and allowed to dry and firm for a short period of time. The inner piece is then joined to the outer piece. This design not only keeps the liquid inside hot, but also the outer surface cool, allowing one to easily hold the cup.

Has a""hashiri-uma"", or galloping horse motif. This motif is said to have been requested by a feudal lord in the mid-1600's to show pride in the region's ability to breed and train quality horses.

Back in the 60's when my brother was in the Navy, he visitied Japan and sent this tea set to our Mom. Somayaki, double-walled pottery set.  The set is 15 pieces, pot, creamer, sugar bowl, 6 cups and 6 saucers. He told her the set whistled when hot water was added. I can't verify this because the set was never used. She displayed it in a cabinet. When she died 8 years ago, the set was packed away. Set is ""cracked"" green with gold accents. One side of the pot has a horse?, and the same design is on the inside bottom of each cup. Opposite the horse on the pot is another design. I have no clue what it is. The saucers have both the horse and other design on them. The bottoms of everything are stamped Made in Japan, and what appears to be Japanese writing. 1 saucer has a small chip, everything else is mint.  I have more pictures available, via email.  $250 or best offer"

I'm extremely interested in buying that one also!!!

 I'm also looking for #3000 of the Indiana Jones 12"" MIB Figures. If you are reading this, please contact me. Name your price. I won't waste your time. I'll pay you cash. We can meet here in my office in Oak Brook. No bogus COA (certificate of authenticity) or box stickers  please. I'm a big fan of this line and been collecting them for years, I know the genuine ones. I have multiples of these and Steve McQueen items already. I'm into the collectible number thingy right now. Contact me if you have any number from 1 to 10 of the horses or number 3000 of the Indy Figure only. Thanks in advance."

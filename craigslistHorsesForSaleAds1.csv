Choice of 2 Horses for Lease!! - $140 (Taylorsville outside of Cartersville)
"I'm now offering two horses for lease at my facility. 

 Palomino mare, Platinum, has been worked with extensively over the past year and a half, she'd never been handled much and absolutely no love given to her before now. She's an excellent horse, rides English or western in my arena or out on trails. She isn't a dead head, on the scale of temperament: 1-10 (1 being totally dead head......10 being hot) she's about a 4.

 Bay Arabian mare, Sugar, the description above applies to this sweet horse too.

 They've been leased for the past year and a half and have done so great and now are well rounded horses all around.

I'm the second owner of this car and it's been fun everyday I've had it. It's a very collectible daily driver that's been well taken care of. Unfortunately, it was involved in a minor fender bender, requiring replacements of the upper and lower rear bumpers. Insurance would not replace the ROUSH bumper so its an OEM part currently. I will knock 200$ off the price for this since you can grab one from americanmuscle.com for 170$. I have regularly washed and waxed it, changed all fluids, and done any maintenance myself. I'm asking under blue book value plus the value of the Roush package since it's a daily driver and has very minor road wear. Price is firm, first come first serve!"

Horses for lease at a beautiful facility! - $225 (Canton)
"I have a list of horses currently for lease! On site or off site will be considered depending on the situation. My farm has a large M10 filled jumping arena, matted 12 by 12 stalls,a small cross country course, a bathroom, hot and cold water, and 30 acres to ride on!

Half leases are 2/3 rides a week and full leases are 3 + rides a week. We have a 3 Day eventer trainer starting Jan 1st if you want to take lessons!

ISHKA: 16 year dutch warmblood. She is a beautiful mover who has done it all. She leg yields like a dream and is extremely responsive. She excels at dressage and like to go over jumps from time to time. Because of her age we like her to be used for flat and light jumping. On site lease only. She is available for half lease at $225 per month.

ATLAS: Gorgeous dapple grey with a great mind. He is  a 16.3 and is my personal riding horse. I only have time to ride a few times per week so he is available for a half lease. He is great on the flat or over jumps. He can jump up to 2'3"" and be ridden by any level of rider...His half lease price is $250 a month.

LENNON: 14.3 welsh/tb cross. We call him Mr. Perfect. He can do it all and bring home ribbons like no other. He looks like a mini warmblood and is super athletic. He can jump up to 3' foot and excels at anything he tries. He is suitable for any age or skill level. Do not let his size deter you! He is available for full or half lease. $225 for half, $375 for full. Off site lease would be considered depending on the situation.

GEORGIA: White QH for someone who likes to just ride for fun. She can be ridden western or english. She does not particularly like to jump so she is for someone who likes flat work and to just enjoy the presence of a beautiful horse. She likes to be groomed and she likes to run from time to time. She is available for half or full lease. $200 for half, $300 for full.

GUSTO: The ultimate trail horse. He loves to be ridden anywhere besides the arena. He is a walkaloosa and has extremely smooth gaits. He is super bombproof and trustworthy and he loves attention:)  He is available onsite or off site. On site his half lease price is $200 per month. 

All horses are sane and well mannered. Call or text me if you have any questions! Thank you!"

 Please text me if interested as I am not always on Here to read the comments :)

First is a gorgeous bay gelding he is 14.2 hands and 10yrs old nice horse ride saddled or bareback with bit or halter. Would make a nice barrel horse with his build and speed when asked would need a little tune up due to sitting for about 5 months. Easy to catch good with feet etc. Asking $550 obo

Second is a big mustang gelding he is 5yrs old and 15.2-15.3 hands he has the faded brand on his neck. He was started on neck reining and worked and moved cows rides off alone or with group pretty laid back guy but due to his age would say he needs a advanced to experienced ridder. Easy keeper on just hay and pasture can only have a handful of grain at a time but is easy keeper on just hay and pasture. You want be disappointed in this guy he is amazing can go in any direction. Asking $750 obo 

Both for $900 obo. Might trade both for a nice trail horse that is taller that 15 hands and ready for trail riding. I DONT HAVE A TRAILER TO HAUL. 

Please text me as I am busy and don't want to skip over anyone's comments :)"

Barn Help Needed (Canton\Cumming\Ballground)
"AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY!!!!  We are looking to hire someone part time to help with our horses(15).  It would be the normal activities, feeding, blanketing, turnin/turnout, etc.   it would probably be around 15-20 hours per week, with the oppurtinity for additional $ at polo games/horse shows.  This would be a great opportunity for someone with some spare time wanting to earn extra cash, who loves horses, or someone looking to break into the business of running a barn.  I am fairly open to a flexible schedule, as long as the schedule is maintained.  

This could grow into a full time position with time, with more responsibility and possibly some oppurtunities.

Please email with Name, Background, References, and $$ per hour or weekly\monthly."

MW Courbette Vision jumping Saddle  $750.00 - $750 (Cherokee County)
"MW Courbette Vision jumping  $750.00. Excellent condition! You won't find a saddle closer to new around! 
DETAILS: 
XC jumping saddle, very forward flap with knee rolls and adjustable calf blocks for stabilizing your lower leg over fences and at a gallop. $2000 new. Courbette no longer makes this saddle, but used versions go from $500-$1000
FITTING 
sized W with a very nice fit that fits most wide to medium wide (ponies, warm bloods, paints) horses. Fits TBs and narrower horses well with use of a mattes pad. Wool flocking in like new condition - full and even. 
17 inch but with the forward flap and can fit/ride like a 17.5 or 18 inch size 
saddle. I typically ride in a 17 1/2 and this saddle fits me great. And accommodate the taller or long-legged rider. 
Two tone leather 
Very well maintained- stored in a climate controlled tack room, wiped down after every use, cleaned and conditioned regularly

Rides well XC as well as a close contact jumping BG saddle. The Twist is a bit on the wider side but I never could feel a difference when riding. This saddle really anchors your leg without lots of bulk while still feeling like a close contact. Great intermediate level saddle for the rider who needs a nice quality jumping saddle to move up through the lower levels. Because of its more ""universal fit"" and wool flocking would also be a great saddle for someone who needs a saddle to fit more than just one horse."

"2009 Featherlite Straight-Load Horse Trailer - $8700 (Pace, FL)"
"Excellent condition 2009 straight load, gooseneck Featherlite trailer for sale! 

We purchased this trailer used in 2009 to haul our two horses to and from horse shows. Horses load via a straight load ramp from the rear into two mangers. Vents along the top allows excellent air flow while trailering. Large tack room and spacious walk through between tack room and stalls. Over the gooseneck there is a large platform which is perfect for a mattress. We used this for a bed when needed. Wiring, gooseneck ball hitch, axels, and tires are in excellent condition. There is a small area of cosmetic damage on the side of the trailer (see pictures). This is purely cosmetic and has no affect on the function of the trailer. 

The trailer has seen almost no use by us. Soon after we purchased the trailer we switched horse trainers. The new trainer provides a trailering service for horse shows. We use this service now rather than trailering ourselves. As a result, this Featherlite trailer has only been used 6 or 8 times and only for a couple of long distance runs. This trailer needs a new home with someone who will use it!

Please let me know if you have any questions."

Get Noticed on this Loud Overo Paint Gelding - $8000 (Dawsonville)
"2003 Paint Gelding - APHA ""Hustling ForBlackjack."" 15.1 hands, bay frame overo with two blue eyes.  Sire is APHA champ and has ROM's & points in WP, barrels, pole bending, halter, reining, trail, & western riding.  Grandson of Red Sonny Dee on top and APHA Champion Huslers Ole Man on bottom.  Paternal granddam is APHA champ as well, Superiors in Hunter Under Saddle, Western Pleasure, & Halter, and points in Western Riding and Working Hunter.   
Has a slow jog but will move out for the English events.  Never finished his lope but a pro would have no problem.  Shown locally in halter and English events.  Can jump 2'6"", but currently most comfortable at 2/2'3"" for courses.  Full flying change on on side, probably needs to get back into better shape for a full change both directions.
Trail rides everywhere, swims.  Has taught lessons for me for little ones, but quickly figures out if kid is a beginner and won't reinforce leg aids - can be slow and lazy but that could be tuned up too.  Just needs to be back in a program, I have very limited time to ride. You can stick a kid on him for a trail ride no problem if he is following the horse you're on.  Cribs when stalled but controlled with collar. 
Not in a rush to sell, only casually marketing him.  I have a baby and 5 horses and nobody is getting worked to their full potential.   I never dreamed of selling this one but the others aren't finished and its time for someone to enjoy Hustler and for him to get working again.  Trailers, clips, 2 front shoes.  Has been barefoot, has had 4 shoes, just depends on workload/if you're trail riding a lot.  Easy keeper, never sick, can live in or out, with company or alone.   First photos are of him and last two are 2 of his sons that I have.  A lifetime of photos and information available (I've had him since he was 17 months).  $8000, you can make an offer, special consideration to the perfect home :) No trades please.

"I am looking for any kind of farm or stable work.  I am a young, in shape, 39 yr old.  I have always worked with all kinds of farm animals my whole life, but my passion is with horses.  Aside from the daily aspects of farm chores I can exercise your horses, put a handle on them like you wouldn't believe while keeping them soft in the mouth, and correct problem behaviours.  I am very detail oriented and very dependable.  
    If you're needing farm help; anything from catching up and hauling cows, mucking stalls, feeding, to riding/training horses or ANYTHING......please call me and you'll be glad you did!  I can provide many references, if needed."
All around gelding (Macon ga)
"Please read ad has all info listed. 

The only reason this guy is for sale is cause I never get to ride him anymore due to no one to ride with. It kills me to part with him but he is to good of horse to sit alone and never get the work/attention he needs. If I could find someone to board at my pasture or me board him somewhere I'd keep him in a heart beat. 

If your looking for an all around gelding check this guy out. He is a very well put together guy. He is around 15.1 hands with a stocky build and muscles to die for. He is 9-10yrs old good for farrier stands tied good loads good etc. he is a nice horse selling as grade. He has been used to move and work cows and has done flag work. Got him hoping he would be my trail horse but I feel he would rather be doing a job such as working cows or would even be good at barrels or western pleasure with some training. He is a good trail horse but just feel he would rather be doing a job vs just walking along the trails he is a pretty quite type guy. Asking $1400 would be interested in possibly trading for a horse that enjoys a good trail ride which is pretty much all I do :). Might also be interested in trading for a medium sized pony/horse and harness and cart or friendly mini horses and goats. PLEASE TEXT ME AT

Appaloosa to Trade for milking equipment/livestock equipment - $700 (Bremen)
"Jelly is a 16 year old Appaloosa gelding. He is partially blind but still rides well. He has a cataract on his left eye. He's about 15 hh. Has a very fun trot and canter. Stands perfectly for the farrier, vet, and for bathing and clipping. VERY easy keeper. His mane grows naturally short and up like in the picture. I've ridden him in shows and parades and he does great. His partial blindness has only come up since last winter. The reason I am letting him go is that my other horses are starting to push him around and I hate to see it. Please email, call, or preferably text me with any questions. Thanks!

Preferably want to trade him for good quality milking equipment for dairy cows. Will also consider any kind of livestock equipment like panels, etc. let me know what you have.

Please do not contact me saying that you can take him for free if I can not sell him. Thanks."

GREAT PAINT HORSE NEEDED GONE - $1500 (Thomaston)
"This guy is young, bold and brave. He's been around tractors, backhoes, four wheelers, golfcarts, and nearly any other type of vehicle and the goofy guy just wants to chase them. He just finished 30 days training back in July with Trey Anderson out of Lizella, GA. He's got loads of potential and tons of character. He's patient with kids and he's lazy. Once he's been lunged (and he needs to be lunged before being ridden) he's perfectly content walking. He's got a fast gallop and could probably make a great kid's barrel horse if trained to the barrels. He's an exceptional trail horse and I take him out for rides on back roads. He does well riding with other horses and is a very social horse.

This is not some back country horse that has been ill trained or ill mannered. I've trained him with Natural Horsemanship for as long as I've had him. He is not, however, a horse to leave a kid who has no experience riding unsupervised on.

Come out and see him, you won't be disappointed.

He's roughly 56"" at his withers and will probably fill out more in his shoulders throughout next year.
He trailers extremely well and will climb up in a small trailer. Stands well for farrier, grooming, ect. I bought him when he was 7 months old off a guy who didn't know much about him, except he is not papered.

This guy has the potential to go places, whether you're just looking for a trail horse or an eventer.

I want him to go to a good home where he'll be put to work. But due to certain circumstances, I'm in need to quickly sell this horse. Please do not low ball me, he is well worth the price I've put on him but I'm willing to negotiate."

Horse Board in Exchange for Work (Covington)
"Must be available weekends(Saturday morning and evening and Sunday morning) and one night a week(probably tuesday or wed). 7-10 horses, feed and turnout, change blankets if needed; pick stalls and fill water buckets and tanks.  Should take a couple of hours.  I would prefer to have someone who has a reason to be at the farm, rather than someone always wanting to get gone as quick as possible. 
Pretty easy work, nice people and relaxed environment, but worker will need an attention to detail. Please have verifiable horse experience. This arrangement is for pasture board, includes feed, but could be modified to be for a stall, with either $ more work or working a horse(if qualified).

"This 2006 Sundowner Gooseneck is in immaculate condition. It has only been used a handful of times then has been sitting under shelter. It is light to haul and very open for horses to load.

The tack shed/dressing room is very spacious and open for as much tack as you need. 
The inside of the trailer is 7ft high so it can accommodate any size horse. 
Sawdust was kept on the floor so the floor mats are untouched from horse manure. It looks like it has just been driven off the lot."

Looking for Mini Boarding
"I am looking for Miniature Horse boarding for two Miniature Horses in/around Cobb or Cherokee county. I know there are several boarding facilities, but Minis need something a bit more....sparse. Currently they are on a family member's farm two hours away on a 1/2 acre dry lot/grass kept short and hand-fed hay and grain. They cannot be boarded on a pasture with larger horses, and they can't be kept in front of a round bale. I would prefer to find someplace with a riding area as I do drive them (carriage.) Looking to move mid-January."

Cute coming 2 year old pony - $400 (Canton)

He also picks up his feet and stands for grooming.   He gets along with other horses. He is healthy and has been kept up to date on all his shots.  Costs next to nothing to feed."
Tifton 85 square bales for sale - $6 (fayette county)
"I have a little less than 50 (maybe 47?) square well packed bales of nice Tifton 85 Bermuda hay I am selling. Nice quality, smells great.  My picky horses are used to finer hay and are not eating it, and I can't stand to see it wasted on the ground.  This hay is more stalky but supposedly higher in protein and good for horses prone to colic because they have to chew it longer.  I just bought it locally not even two weeks ago but have decided to find more like I am used to feeding.  You pay what I paid (6.50 a bale), it's been kept covered in my barn, I would like to sell all bales if possible.  Located in Fayette county."
"Wooden Rocking Horse by John Sprankell (""His"" Idea Crafts) - $75 (Post Rd & Hwy 20)"
"John Sprankell has signed this #12395, hand-made, wooden, rocking horse as part of the ""His"" Idea Crafts company he and his wife, Anna, started.  It was made in 1998, but shows little wear and tear (see pictures).  We have not even had to paint it.

Here's an interesting story I found about Mr. & Mrs. Sprankell, their daughters, and how their company got its start:

His Idea Crafts, Dayton, Tennessee-based makers of heirloom-quality wooden rocking horses, had been in business two years before getting its first big break.

At the time, owners John and Anna Sprankell couldn't afford a vacation, so they piled their girls and a few of the hand-crafted horses into the car and headed for Gatlinburg, promising the girls that if they sold one horse, they'd get a hotel room and stay overnight. Well, they sold all the horses they had and took orders for 20 more. From there, business took off at a gallop.

That was 20 years ago. To date, the Sprankells have built more than 24,000 rocking horses, and these beautiful, handcrafted horses have been featured on QVC and Tennessee Crossroads.

The unique rocking horses are sold in multiple retail outlets throughout the state and on the Internet, and have been shipped to all 50 states and 16 countries.

John Sprankell is quick to give God the credit. ""It was 'His' idea,"" he says. See ""His"" horses at www.allhishorses.com."
Charlie 1 Horse Cowboy Hat - $125 (Dawsonville)
"I used this hat when showing Western Pleasure but no longer show horses.  I would love someone to get it that will love it as much as I did.  It is a Charlie 1 Horse hat that is felt and leather.  I would say that the leather color is Chestnut Brown and felt is Chocolate Brown.

When I originally bought it I know that I spent over $200+ for it.  I have it stored in a plastic hat carrier in which that will come with the hat to keep it in good shape for you.

Size 7 56cm (Medium)

Let me know if you have any additional questions and Enjoy your day!"

Appaloosa Gelding - $1000
"Beautiful Appaloosa Gelding for sale. Experienced trail horse, will take you through and over anything you point him at!  Energetic horse, likes to move with a purpose, NOT a nag! Very friendly horse, likes people! He is big boned, about 15'2, not registered, about 15 years old.  Very handsome guy, flowing gates, easy on the eyes! Has only one flaw: prefers to ride with other horses and does not like to be left behind, can get a little strong, but remains under control and therefore requires a somewhat experienced rider! Needs a job, he is too much horse in my beginner lesson program and I don't have time to ride him myself."

Notes I stopped at row @ servicios para lanchas

1. Create individual scrapers for each given category. 
2. After form submits scrape all the things and then go to the next page and scrape those two if it exists. 
3. Wrap those scrapers with methods that can have searches passed to them. 
4. Call each method and search each category for that keyword.

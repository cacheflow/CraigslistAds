Re: Reptiles and Tarantulas (duluth)
Just wanted to put in a good word for the young man selling the reptiles and tarantulas. He is a real stand up guy who is completely honest and trustworthy when it comes to selling his reptiles. I bought a leapard gecko from him and couldn't be happier with my dealings with this kid. Wouldn't hesitate for a second to buy from him again.
Showcase Bird Aviary or Reptile enclosure (Suwanee)
"GIVE YOUR BEAUTIFUL CREATURES A PRIMO HOME!

Vintage oak bird aviary (could be used for reptiles).  This wonderful furniture type aviary was made by the original couple that owned Natures Window that was at the Galleria.  The original painting (can be replaced by glass or possibly another painting if you so desire) on the back was done and signed by the wife.  These enclosures were $1800 to $2800 (approx) when new.  It is wired with a fan and air purifying filter for circulation, as well as lighting.  I purchased this from the original owner and never used it.  Was going to do a shabby chic finish on it.  He kept finches in it.  

Condition:  it could use a little work for someone that is handy.  Overall in good vintage condition.  Glass sides, front, and back painting simply slide in and out.  The glass is double paned so you can clean one while the other remains to hold in your feathered (or scaled) friends.  Missing one side panel of glass.  Both light fixtures work.  They are attached to a timer.  Not certain if timer is working.  Electrical to fan is functional, but fan might need to be repaired or replaced as it does not turn.  Needs new air filter that should be replaced on a regular basis.  Should be standard and easy to find.  

A few photos were taken without glass panels inserted.

Re: Re: Beware of Bearded Dragons and Leopard Geckos in Loganville (Loganville)
"After seeing the defense response, I went looking for the ""attack"" post and read it.

I deal with birds, not reptiles. So I personally have no interaction with this person. HOWEVER, I have seen the ads here many times and want to confirm his defense that he has not been trying to ""sell them for a year"".

He has been selling REPTILES for about a year now, on here. But NOT the same ones. They're all different! Whether he operates a rescue or breeds them, I don't know (and personally don't care). But he has offered a wide range of reptiles on here at different times. Thus the crap about trying to offload them for a year is an invalid argument. And knowing that, the rest of your attack seems pretty useless anyway.

Also, actual scammers, irreputable breeders, animal flippers, etc., don't usually make posts in self-defense anyway. Bad people just disappear and run! So seeing his very lengthy explanation complete with phone number to call and talk, tells me you're probably one of those who doesn't get their way and tries to take down a good person for it!"

"Currently looking to rehome my bearded dragon to make more room for other reptiles. 

She is less than 6 months old,  about a foot long, & Orange German Giant x Leatherback. She is very friendly and loves to be held. I've never had any issues with her, just wanting to venture outside of beardies. 

Everything that I have for her will go with her. 
•40 gallon tank (does NOT include tank stand)
•Dual lamp fixture w/ extra heat bulb
•Tube light
•All food and calcium supplements 
•All decor in the tank and others that we do not have in the picture.

I'd like to see her go to someone with experience with beardies. She's been well cared for and I won't just let her go to anyone. We've spent well over $1000 in her habitat and care. She makes an awesome pet and is good with kids as well!

$400 to rehome with all items OBO.
Willing to negotiate.
Please email or text (will not answer calls) if interested. Will list all items that we have for her."

Iguana Needs a New Home (comes with cage) (norcross)
"I have a 3 1/2 year old green iguana male. He has been well cared for and is healthy. I got him before I started high school, but I am about to graduate in May. Unfortunately, I cannot take him to college with me so he is in need of a new home. He is handled weekly and stays in my room, so he is comfortable around people, and is particularly fond of women. He is about 3ft long and lives in his enclosure. He eats a mixture of leafy greens and Adult Iguana dried pellets from Petsmart as well. He is relatively low maintenance and a good pet for anyone interested in reptiles. He has a leash and on hot and humid days he has gone outside and enjoyed basking in the sun. He is a beautiful creature and needs a home of someone that will appreciate him.
His enclosure is 5ftx4ftx3ft with a foot of storage space on the bottom. It has two hanging lamps that use 150 watt UVA and UVB lights I buy from Petsmart (Zoomed brand). He has a large(2ft) water bowl to soak in and drink from. There are climbing shelves attached to the walls other climbing toys positioned to help him get around. He also has rocks for decoration, two rolls of brown eco turf - where I put his food -and mulch surrounding the rest for a substrate (mulch will need to be changed every two weeks or so). Extra lights, and timers (so that the days are normal for him) are included as well as extra food pellets to help get you started!

*In the first picture, there is a humidifier, since then the plants have died and the humidifier broke- I have been misting him to keep the humidity up. I recommend buying some yucca trees for decoration (and a treat, he loves to leaves) so it might be best to get two and cycle them but it is too cold to leave the plants out. You can use an old Windex bottle to add humidity to the cage, however it is easier to use a humidifier. 
**There is a $300 rehoming fee because of his cage and extra."

exotic pet sitter (Alpharetta. )
"Do you have an animal that can't just be left at a kennel while youre away? An animal that has complex needs or needs individualized attention? If so, I would love to pet sit for you. I am an avid animal lover and I have a soft spot for exotics. I understand the extra time and attention required to care for these animals. 
 Birds, reptiles, snakes, geckos, hedgehogs, sugar gliders, chinchilas, etc. I'll do them all. The animal must be brought to my home so that I can monitor and care for it 24/7. Prices depend on the animal and the complexity of the care required, but I am doing this because I love animals, not for the money.   I do have experience with exotics and have owned chinchillas, hedgehogs, leopard geckos, bearded dragons, anoles, rabbits, and many other small mammals and I currently own an array of lizards including an iguana and bearded dragons. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 

I cannot pet sit dogs or cats. No snakes over 6 feet please.   I have no problem with large reptiles such as full grown iguanas or monitor lizards.

Reptile Rescue (Boaz)
"Hello all! I personally take in non venomous snakes that need homes. I am very experienced at handling and caring for snakes so you will be at peace knowing your snake is in good hands.

I currently have three rescues, and two more that I purchased. All the snakes I take in have their own tanks/tubs and get all kinds of play time. I am a disabled mother and have plenty of time to give great care to these reptiles. 

If the snakes I rescue need vet attention I make sure they get it. My ball pythons all eat regularly f/t rats on the same day every week and my cornsnakes eat f/t mice same day every week.

I do not take cash donations though snake or mice supplies are always needed. Racks, tubs, aspen or cypress snake bedding, under the tank heaters, hides, bowls, etc.

I do not rehome the snakes I take in either. They become members of my family. I also have been known to pay a small rehoming fee if the snake I rescue is healthy and has its own supplies. There arent many, if any, rescues for snakes and Im glad I can be there for them when needed. I look forward to hear from you. Thanks and have a great day!"
Reptile need a new home? (Everywhere)
"Anyone need to rehome their reptiles? Lizards, snakes, and turtles are welcome! I can pay small rehoming fees if you'd need. Lizards and turtles must come with their set up. Snakes do not need it.

I'm located in Rome, so you must be willing to meet within a 50 mile radius. I do travel to Chatanooga once a month, so I could meet along there if you'd like."

"Lobster Roach Pets & Feeders for Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, Mammals - $10 (alpharetta)"
"I have lobster roaches available that make excellent feeders for a variety of different animals and are also good pets and teaching aids/class animals. They are very easy to keep and breed and if you have the correct setup you will never have any escape. This species can climb but are easily stopped with a layer of Vaseline around the inside lip of a container, a firmly place lid, or a sticky layer of tape or similar product around the upper container lip (I can provide all information needed to successfully keeping these guys). They are the prefect replacement for expensive crickets and can be feed food scraps and leftovers or high nutritional foods for gut loading. They can also be handled if you are looking for a pet. 

Note this species is NOT capable of infesting a home.

$10 for 25 roaches of mixed size (with enough adults to produce offspring quickly). 

I also have other reptile/amphibian feeders available including a few different species of springtails, many different species of isopods, fruit flies (D. melanogaster and D. hydei), bean weevils, and flour beetles. 

Please email me if you have any questions, thanks."

All amenities are included with two cages and two heating pads 4 lamps 2 heating ceramic bulbs huge corner bowls and extra bedding. Rock shelters and humidity/temp gauges are included.

There are several subspecies of boa constrictor (species name boa constrictor ) that are found in the pet trade. Red tailed boas ( Boa constrictor constrictor ) are commonly found in the pet trade, and Boa constrictor imperator can be found as well, among other less common subspecies. The care for all the species is fairly similar.
Before committing to ownership of a boa constrictor, be sure you will be able to handle the size and strength of a full grown snake for the 25-30 years your snake might live. A full grown boa constrictor (red tailed) will reach 8-10 feet long and weigh up to 50 pounds. These are very muscular and thick bodied snake. While generally quite docile in temperament, it is important to respect the inherent strength of these animals. 

Physical Features
Newborn red-tailed boa constrictors are 14 to 22 inches long and weigh a measly 2 ounces. However, within its first year, that baby who fits in the palm of your hand will grow up to 8 feet long. A fully grown adult red-tailed boa can easily reach 10 feet in length and 50 pounds in weight. His brown and gray scales are adorned with brownish black oval patches that become increasingly red towards the base of his tail.
Behavior
Red-tailed boas generally are docile snakes, though wild-caught boas tend to be more aggressive than captive-bred boas. In the wild, they're solitary reptiles, preferring to spend their days in hollow logs and abandoned mammal burrows or, being partially arboreal snakes, hanging on low branches. They generally only spend time together during mating, which can take place at any point throughout the year.
Habitat
Wild red-tailed boas prefer woodlands, semi-arid forests and tropical rain forests. Though they love warm, humid weather, boas are nocturnal and spend the hot days lazing about under logs or cooling off in rivers, and the cooler nights hunting prey. Captive boas don't have the luxury of the Amazon rain forest and need an enclosure with a daytime air temperature between 82 and 90 degrees, with a separate ""basking"" area kept between 90 and 95 degrees. At night the temperature should go no lower than 78 degrees. Clean, sturdy branches for climbing, a suitable hiding place -- hollow logs work well -- and fresh water can ensure your pet red-tailed boa remains happy and healthy.
Diet
Red-tailed boa constrictors are carnivores. Their natural prey includes rats, mice, amphibians, snakes, birds, eggs and small mammals. In captivity, most boas eat mice, rats, rabbits and even chickens. Red-tailed boas aren't constant eaters; in some cases a large meal can sustain a boa for up to a month. A boa kills its prey by squeezing it to death with its powerful coils. Once its prey has suffocated, the boa constrictor consumes it whole."

"Here are some items that I have been holding on to in anticipation of my next 944. Well, That's not happening for a while so here they go up for sale. 
I am selling as a lot. I will not separate. Whoever buys this will be getting a GREAT DEAL! 

First is the 944 Short Shift kit. It's a cool addition and works with all things 944. I did not install it and it is still in the box it came in. I put one of these on my 944 Turbo several years ago and it really shortened the ""Throw"" between gears. Makes driving a lot of fun. 

Next is the Nose Bra. 
It is black and is in good shape. NOTE: It will fit S-2, Turbo models and any modified 944 with the Turbo nose cone. 

Next are the black floor Mats with ""PORSCHE"" embroidered on them. These look Great and have \very little wear. 

Then we have the car cover. 
It is a PORSCHE car cover made for the 944/Turbo/S2/ 968 etc. It have been used very little and will do the job of keeping the birds away from your paint job.   

NOTE: The pictures of the items are stock pics to give you a REAL idea what these things look like. 
These are NOT Pictures of the actual items. I do not have a 944 to ""model"" these things on so this was the next best thing. 

I have some other items that I will throw in if I can find them. E-brake pads, electronic ignition module and stuff like that. Again, That is if I can find them. 

PLEASE pay heed. 
I do NOT want to trade for reptiles, day spa certificates, football tickets or anything else. This is a Cash only transaction and will be executed face to face in the Cumming, GA area. 

Please call to come pick these items up. 
Again, it's an ALL or NOTHING transaction."

"This is a beautiful parrot house made by a friend of mine who makes custom furniture for a living. Greg had a large African parrot that he built this house for. He no longer has the parrot and has moved to a smaller home.

I must tell you that this is a LARGE item and you must have the ceilings for it. That is my son standing by it and he is 6ft tall. The top steeple will come off for transport. The house is just under 9ft. tall, 37in. wide, and 35in. deep. Like I said this is custom built by a furniture maker, and as usual, they make the best for themselves. Let's get together and talk. I am sure that we can make a deal if you own such a bird, or you could screen the inside to accommodate smaller birds or reptiles, whatever! It was also suggested that it could be a liquor cabinet, a gun cabinet, even a linen cabinet. Lots of possibilities! $3500.00 Buford.

dubia roaches- reptile/amphibian food at a low price! - $15 (Gainesville/Flowery Branch)
"Are you tired of dealing with crickets? We were, and we have been so thankful that we made the switch! Read below for more information and the different buying options-

Excellent feeder insects! A newer, better food for your reptile (great for lizards- geckos, bearded dragons, etc), amphibian, tarantula, and even chickens, at a low price.

About Dubia Roaches: 

(Blaptica Dubia) Dubia cockroaches have become popular for feeding reptiles and amphibians as well as larger carnivorous invertebrates (such as tarantulas) because they are a high quality herp food source that is easier to raise than crickets. The males have a full set of wings when mature, and the females have small wing stubs when they are mature.


**Compared to the Discoid or Orange Headed Roaches:

Dubia Roaches are slower moving but not nearly as shy as other kinds of roaches. Dubia roaches are good feeders compared to other roach species because they are slower moving, do not climb, and do not fly. Of the three species, Dubia Roaches have the softest exoskeleton making them an excellent food item for arachnids and small lizards, as well as larger species such as iguanas and monitors. 


**Compared to crickets:

The adults are very meaty; one adult dubia equals about 10 large crickets. Dubia are a meaty roach with a soft body which contain a much higher ratio of protein to indigestible chitin compared to crickets. They also produce no odor, make no noise, don't jump out of the enclosure, are less picky eaters, are a lot more hardy, and are calm and easy to handle for feeding. Instead of having an escaped cricket forcing you to go ""camping"" at home, if you drop a roach they are easy to catch. The Dubia Roach are exceptionally poor climbers and can not climb glass or smooth plastic, making them easy to work with.

Reptiles (geckos) for sale! Buy one get one 50% off until January 1st! (Auburn)
"I have two species of geckos for sale, crested geckos and leopard geckos. As the title says, I will be having a buy one get one 50% off sale going on until January 1st. Buy one gecko, get another of the same value or lesser for half price. It can be one of each species or both the same species, doesn't matter to me as long as you or the recipient of the reptile knows how to take care of the species. I prefer to have local pickup, but I can ship if needed. I have a flat rate of $60 shipping done through Reptiles Express. Weights for each animal along with hatch dates if applicable are available on request. 

I have a female leopard gecko, Bold Jungle morph. Wanted to breed her this past season, but she reaches a plateau in her weight almost the whole season. She has gone above this plateau now and has gained more. Beautiful girl, just don't have the space or time for her anymore. Was not produced by me so I do not have her hatch dates. Asking $45 for her. 

Another female leopard gecko, SHTCTB morph. Still skinny from breeding but otherwise healthy. Active and alert as always. Also not produced by me, so no hatch dates. Asking $65 for her. 

This female I'm not sure if I will be selling or not, but I am considering it. She's a Tangerine Enigma het DB, only shows minimal signs of enigma syndrome. She's a very sweet girl, always been a favorite of mine with her curious and unique personality. That's why I'm hesitant to sell her, along with the fact that I'm considering breeding her. Make me an offer if you are interested in her, please no low ballers. Serious buyers only, would prefer someone experienced with enigmas but since she does not show strong signs of it, it is not necessary. 

Next is an unsexed juvenile, hypo tangerine het bell albino. Produced by me, hatch date available. He's docile for his age and has never hissed or bitten. If buying for children, iI would recommend ages 10 up for him. He might be docile but he will not tolerate rough handling. Has very pretty eyes, has lavender on him but I don't think it will stick. When he was younger he had some green, but it faded. Asking $40 for him. 

Last leo is another unsexed juvenile, aberrant sunglow. Full blood sibling to the hypo tangerine het bell. Appears to be turning out just like the mother, can provide pictures of the mother on request. I do not have a picture of the father as I bought the mother gravid. A month younger than the hypo so this one is smaller. I would not recommend for children, teenagers should be fine. 

Now onto the crested geckos, the first is a beautiful high end harlequin male, could becconsidered a tricolor. Very docile and should produce amazing babies. I'm getting rid of all my cresteds and he was my most valuable one, sad to see him go. Asking $120 for him. Price reflects the quality. 

Next is a female dalmatian, not nearly as docile as the harlequin but can be tamed. Has never bitten. Was originally a rescue, started off very malnourished but it was easy to fatten her up. Very active and amusing to watch. Asking $55 for her. 

Last is an unsexed juvenile, looking like a yellow tiger. Kind of in between the other two cresties in terms of temperament, not wild but not docile either. He/she is turning out beautiful and should continue to do so. Asking $50 for him/her.

Thank you for looking and I hope you like what you see! I am happy to answer any questions about the species or individual animals. I love all of them, but sadly cannot afford to keep them anymore. I hope they will all find good homes with you!"

"REHOME your small animals with me, experienced animal caretaker - $1 (birmingham, surrounding area)"
"Hello! If you have a small animal in need of a home, for whatever reason, please contact me. Below is a list of some of the animals I take. If you do not see your animal on the list, feel free to inquire. Unfortunately, at this time I am unable to take cats and dogs. However, If you have a farm animal, I MAY know someone that could help. Shoot me an email or text (please no calls unless after 5pm as I have little to no service at work)

I am experienced caring for all types of animals, so you can be sure your pet is going to a loving, caring home where he or she will receive all the proper care and attention they need!

I do not mind driving a ways to pick up your animal! If you can, please include whatever supplies/cages you have for them. If this is not available, just let me know and I will be sure to have made arrangements for the animal before I pick him or her up. 

Please note that NONE of these animals will EVER be fed to anything. They will be cared for and kept as pets. Each animal will get the veterinary care it needs. They are never sold- I do this to help animals have good homes, not to make a buck. 

Animals I take in:

REPTILES
geckos
lizards
iguanas
snakes
turtles
scorpion
tarantulas
any other reptile

FISH
any fish or aquatic animal

RODENTS
bunnies
rats
mice
guinea pigs
gerbils
chinchillas
ferret
other rodents

BIRDS
any bird (at the time there are no empty bird cages, so all birds must come with their cage)

Again, if you have a question about ANYTHING, whether it is what animals I take or something else, please do not hesitate to contact me."

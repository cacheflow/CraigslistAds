  LUCCHESE WOMEN'S SIZE 9B BOOTS - $225 (Cumming)
"
"
        I received these boots as a B-day gift from my parents. Unfortunately they are the wrong size. They were ordered on-line & cannot be returned. 

As you can tell from the pictures, they have never been worn. They are Women's size 9 B, Lucchese's run a little more narrow than other boots. If you're not familiar with this brand, I would suggest trying them on in a store near you, to make sure the fit is good. Depending on what kind of socks you wear will also affect the fit of the boot. I wear a thinner sock on my left foot, because it's a little bigger than the right.

The description of the boot is: Tan Burnished (distressed) Mad Dog Goat Skin, Hand-made in USA (TX), Leather Piping, Leather Outsole, Cushioned Insole, Shaft height 13"", Heel height 1 3/4"", Snip-toe style. This is a great price, plus save $ on sales tax.

  Alinco Dog Mascot Costume  - $800 (Columbus, GA)
"
"
        I bought this costume years ago from Alinco Costumes. If you go to their site you will see this costume selling for $1,499.00 right now. 

I have had it at my shop and it has gotten a little dusty so it could probably use a cleaning but it is still in good shape. I have all the parts that go along with him like the head, body suit, hands and feet. It also comes with a piece you put on before you put on the body that makes you look fat and fills out the body.

I'm asking for $800 OBO.

If interested text me at 706 three three two 9818 or e-mail me. either way make sure you leave your contact info or I will have to assume it's a scam. I will only take cash and local sales only, I won't ship it. 
The photo I'm using is off of Alinco's website. I did not take pictures of the one I have but it is the same costume.

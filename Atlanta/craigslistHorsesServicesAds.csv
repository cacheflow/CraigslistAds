Horses boarded (Woodstock)
"20 stall barn and 6 acres with multiple fenced pastures minutes from Hwy 92 at I-575. We own 3 horses and plan to board just two more. GREAT PRICE, various options on feed etc.  If interested call to discuss. Shannah & Brian"
pasture boarding horses (Maysville)
"3 1/2 acre pasture available for pasture boarding your horses.       New fencing being put in now and will be ready for horses by 12/24.    $135/mo per pasture boarded horse.       

Owner lives on 10 acre property with 180' x 100' unfenced riding ring and 10 stall barn with tack room and wash area.      I may be interested in renting the stalls ($190/mo) but horse owner would be responsible for horse's care and feeding.      I will not rent out the stalls unless I believe you will keep your horse's stall mucked.

Bottom line is while I grew up on a horse and enjoy having them around my business doesn't allow me the time to fully maintain horses in stalls so while I will make sure the pasture boarded horses have water and hay/grass I can't be responsible for mucking stalls ect.       I may be able to handle feeding for horses in the stalls occasionally."

Want to ride a horse? (Marietta)
"Have you always wanted to ride a horse? Or have you ridden before but it's been TOO LONG? I offer FUN beginner lessons and trail rides! 

 The barn is located in West Cobb, less than four miles from the Marietta Square and about 30 minutes (non-rush hour) from downtown Atlanta. I regularly teach a small handful of youngsters and really enjoy showing folks 'the ropes'. You can ride out with me over miles of pastures and trails while I teach you the basics.

 Our two horses are wonderful! I'll ride Amarillo, a beautiful golden-coated quarter horse who is well-trained and loves his job. You'll be on Galaxy, the cutest dapple-grey fellow you've ever seen! He's a quarter horse / Arabian mix who measures just a bit taller than 'pony'. Since we bought him in March, he has proven himself to be a fun and safe ride for beginners and experts alike. (Although Galaxy carries my 6 foot tall and large frame with ease, we limit riders to 250 pounds for his safety and comfort.)

 If you've never ridden before (or are a bit nervous about being back in the saddle) I can 'pony' Galaxy behind Amarillo for the entire ride. (This means I ride Amarillo while holding a lead rope attached to Galaxy's bridle.) The horses are well-bonded and extremely used to this arrangement, so you can concentrate on learning and having FUN.

 Want a 'shared experience' with a friend or loved one? I cannot take two out at once. BUT we can all saddle up together; then one takes a trail ride with me to a convenient meeting place; then the other rides the same route back home.

The 1Â½ Hour Experience includes approximately 30 - 45 minute 'talk & tack', plus 45 - 60 minutes in the saddle. Riding options include a variety of trails and pastures. The 2Â½ Hour Experience includes a longer trail ride with an on-horseback tromp through a large creek. All you need is a pair of comfortable pants and sturdy shoes. (Riding boots recommended, but not required.) I can provide the mandatory riding helmet.

 1Â½ Hour Experience prices: $50 during school hours (Mon - Fri, 8 am - 3 pm); $65 for after-school hours, weekends and holidays.

 2Â½ Hour Experience prices: $80 during school hours (Mon - Fri, 8 am - 3 pm); $95 for after-school hours, weekends and holidays.

The Earth and it's animal occupants are not here to be used,neglected and controlled for our own selfish purposes, but instead we are to be stewards and guardians of them. Both myself and my fiancee, partner, who is registered under the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians and also of Creek Indian descent, ( I am of strong Cherokee and Celtic descent ) are peaceful, gentle and nature oriented folk. We strive every day to live a life in honor of and memory of the gentle, spiritual and wise Native Ways of our ancestors.

Home Health/ Patient Care Technician
"I worked for a large cardiology group at St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta for many years and have spent the last 6 years at an assisted living and memory care facility as an independent caregiver. I have been in the medical field since 1996. I am a Patient Care Technician, Medical Assistant, CPR/First Aid certified and TB negative. My skills include: working with Dementia and Alzheimer's disease, companionship, bathing, grooming and hygiene, medication reminders, errand services/grocery services. I also do meal preparation, schedule and transport to doctors' appointments, light housekeeping and am experienced with pets. I have a mother who is 96, and has a few disabilities. She loves life and is a social butterfly. She lives in a assisted living facility because she likes her independence. 
I took a patient I was taking care of who has Alzheimer's to my barn, because I heard how responsive they were with horses. The experience was wonderful and it has changed my career direction. I am in school now getting certified with PATH out of Denver. (Professional Association Of Therapeutic Horsemanship). Most of my studying is on the computer and my clinical work is being done in Crabapple, Georgia, so it will never interfere with my work hours.

On full board, we will handle the horse as you like, if you like them to stay in all the time we can, but typically we will put the horse out to pasture early in the morning and put them back in the stalls and feed them in the evening, except in summer time, we put the horses in at 9am and out at 6pm.

Owners of the farm live on the premises and a full time farm hand / horse caretaker and trainer lives on-site above the barn, please realize we are a small 'boutique' farm. we have 4 horses or our own and aren't looking for this as a business, all thought we take VERY good care of our horses and boarders with FULL TIME LIVE above the barn Staff.

About Me
I love dogs and cats, and animals in general. I have a hard time saying no to them, which is how I came to have two cats! Growing up, my family always had cats and dogs, and many other animals. Most recently I have cared for my parents two golden retrievers and I helped housebreak one of them. I have spent a lot of time riding and training horses and working in and around barns. 
I am comfortable handling dogs of all sizes and ages, and I am happy to take care of any special health needs your pet might have. 
At the moment I have a very flexible and open schedule and I am willing to travel. I prefer to care for your pets at your home, where they will be most comfortable, but am willing to consider caring for small dogs (30lb and under) in in my apartment.  If you have cats or other pets that need to be cared for I can do that as well!

About My Services
My rate is $25 per night

About Me
I love dogs and cats, and animals in general. I have a hard time saying no to them, which is how I came to have two cats! Growing up, my family always had cats and dogs, and many other animals. Most recently I have cared for my parents two golden retrievers and I helped housebreak one of them. I have spent a lot of time riding and training horses and working in and around barns. 
I am comfortable handling dogs of all sizes and ages, and I am happy to take care of any special health needs your pet might have. 
At the moment I have a very flexible and open schedule and I am willing to travel. I prefer to care for your pets at your home, where they will be most comfortable, but am willing to consider caring for small dogs (30lb and under) in in my apartment.  If you have cats or other pets that need to be cared for I can do that as well!

Equine Appraisal Service (Coweta County area)
"Selling a horse? Buying a horse? Getting a divorce? Child Support payments being adjusted? Want more alimony? Or maybe you need to insure one - whatever the need, you need a fair and IMPARTIAL third party appraisal of that horse's true value. 

Value of a horse can vary - breeding, show record, sex, age, temperament, soundness, and even the purpose of the appraisal all factor into the final dollar value shown on the appraisal report. 

Reports will show comparable animals used to generate the numbers along with photographs and brief descriptions. Every effort is made to compare ""apples to apples"". 

Stop guessing what that horse is worth. Stop relying on what your trainer (who wants you to stay his customer and who will inflate the price) or the barn manager (who may have his own horses to sell and may decrease the price) tell you. You certainly do not want the auction ring master to dictate the value. 

Call Wright Place Equine Appraisal or email for terms and appointments."

Work To Ride (Flowery Branch)
"Hi,
My name is Caity and I am offering to help you with your horses (any stablehand work, anything you need) for an exchange to receive riding lessons/ riding time. I have been in a work to ride program before in North Carolina/South Carolina and since I had to move I am currently looking for another program here in Georgia. Unfortunately, my family is going through some tough times and there is no way I could ever get a horse so I am willing to work completely free just to spend time with horses. If you know of anyone or you yourself would like my help please contact me without hesitation, and feel free to ask me any questions! Thank you and God bless!"

Sunset Bird Sanctuary accepting unwanted pet birds (McDonough)
"Sunset Bird Sanctuary is taking in unwanted pet birds. Specialized care for everything from Hyacinth Macaws to Zebra Finches, and all species in between.

We are a LICENSED, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION. We do not BUY animals, nor do we SELL them. As a matter of fact, most animals we take in, are never adopted out. Many animals come here to find their actual ""forever"" home - a place where they can finish their natural lives in peace without being passed around any more. This was the wish of a dying man who asked that his estate go towards this cause. So here we are.

VERY RARELY do we adopt animals back out. Please do not contact us looking for a new pet, because we most likely don't have any up for adoption. We have had people who needed to ""dump"" several pets at once, and couldn't wait to rehome all of them, and ask us to take them and find new homes for them. But NO animal is adopted out of here unless specifically requested by the surrendering owner.

We can rehabilitate sick and injured animals as well and give many of them a forever home right here in our facility in Henry County. We grow much of our pets' food right here on the property including mealworms, earthworms, crickets, fruits, and vegetables for a diet as close to natural as possible. Birds are given time in huge outdoor flight cages in warm weather and we have over 70 acres available to build and expand. We currently have 8 volunteers who are mostly retired or disabled people. This means all of our birds get plenty of human interaction, socialization, and love!

Rest assured that if you can no longer care for them, your pet will live out a very happy and healthy life with us.

We are also accepting donations of cages, pens, toys, and food to help us accomodate more incoming animals, and continue caring for the permanent residents here. Again, we are a licensed, NON-PROFIT organization.

Our sanctuary is NOT open to the public, and we do not allow tours for many reasons. We want these animals to live in PEACE and not worry about contagious diseases affecting the entire sanctuary. All incoming animals are kept quarantined until they are given a clean bill of health. Because of this, we will gladly pick the animals up from your location, or meet you halfway.

Dwarf hamster babies for adoption -  $10/pair or $15/trio (Kennesaw)
"I rescued four hamsters and found out (after all three females had babies) that one of the four was a male; he has now been re-homed so this does not happen again in the future, but I now have (2) male and (9) female five week old babies, as well as (1) 14 week old female who need homes. These babies have just started being handled daily and they are very receptive; still shy and a little jumpy, but no nipping biting and they will only continue to calm down with more handling. I am only re-homing them as pairs (or trios) and the adoption fee is $10.00/pair or $15.00/trio - you must have a cage to adopt. I have three new CritterTrail cages with all accessories/supplies available to sell with a pair/trio of hamsters - $55.00 for a pair of hamsters with the cage - which includes a wheel, water bottle, and food bowl - as well as all remaining food, bedding, toys, treats, cleaning supplies, dust bath, etc. Please keep in mind these hamsters are $15.00-$16.00 each at PetsMart and Petco and pet store hamsters are no where near as friendly and socialized as these babies will be. 

Adoption fee is NOT negotiable; I want to ensure they go to a great home and not adopted on a whim because someone saw a free hamster. Once on solid food, they will be fed a combination of Kaytee Fiesta seed mix and Kaytee complete pellet food, along with supplements of timothy hay and alfalfa cubes, so they will be used to a variety of goodies daily.  I am located in Kennesaw - north metro Atlanta (Cobb County)  if you are not able or willing to drive to Kennesaw, please do not respond as I will not drive to meet. Serious inquires ONLY please, and please only inquire about adopting if you have researched (or currently/previously owned) dwarf hamsters and intend to provide a home for the next +/- TWO years."
Weimaraner mix for adoption (gainesville)
"Blue was born around June 2011 and he is up to date on shots and neutered. He has been kept as an only pet. he is very playful. He just loves to play ball. Due to his strength and height we do not suggest  he be homed with small dogs, cats, or children under 12.
He would be best with a stay at parent since he likes to sit around and watch tv or go outside and play ball. He is super strong and super loving he seems to be smiling all the time. He is so full of life. If you think you would make a good parent for
Blue please leave a contact number as he is hoping that you will be perfect for him. Adoption fee applies."

Adopt Josie the Perfect Pet
"Josie is a 2 yr old purebred mutt. Talk about a couch hog! Josie is very laid back. If you want to spend a rainy day inside -- she's your snuggle buddy. If you're on the move, she's right there with you. She loves playing with other dogs at daycare and doesn't pay attention to cats. Josie is kid friendly and shy at first, but loves women.  Once you have her trust she is lab-loyal. Josie is especially slow to warm up to men -- maybe she had a rough life before she was rescued from her days as a yard dog. She would like you to know she's housebroken and happy to go in a kennel when you leave the house if you give her a couple treats. She would like to sleep in her doggie bed at the foot of your human bed and although she might ask to get into your bed, she gets it that you're not into it. The ideal home would be someone who can give a bit of patience and understanding with this shy girl -- she promises big rewards. 

$125 rescue fee includes all vet work. She is up-to-date on all vaccines, spayed and HW negative.

I am her foster mom and will do a home check once an inquiry has been made. Josie is in the city of Decatur and attends dog adoption events. We are happy to also meet at your home. She is living in 30030 city of Decatur area.

For a ton of photos, please take a look at the YouTube link.

Young male cat needs a home (Kennesaw)
"Chester is a big, long haired, young cat in need of an indoor home. He enjoys being around people and he's very friendly. He enjoys being held and petted, he is litter box trained, and would make a great pet. He has recently been neutered, micro chipped and has had his first vaccinations and de-worming treatments. His owner is gone and he has been left behind to fend for himself outdoors. He is a sweet, beautiful pet looking for a loving owner to adopt him. A small adoption fee is required."

Cat needs quiet home-updated (Buford)
"I am looking for the perfect home for a young male cat. He is solid black with short hair and enormous yellow eyes. 
UPDATE- Slinky was neutered and got his rabies shot last week. He has recovered nicely from the procedure and is ready for a new home. He gets friendlier and less scared of the other pets every day but still prefers the quiet bathroom. He loves to be petted and has the loudest purr! 

Slinky came to live with us when we went to check on a disabled family member who recently rented a room in an apartment. The cat had been left behind by someone who lived there previously, and had been living locked in a small bathroom for several weeks. Slinky was filthy, underweight and terrified. I brought him home thinking that he was wild and would make a nice barn cat. But after 1 day, it was obvious that this little guy is a house pet. He loves to be petted and  snuggled, even by the kids.  He has been a perfect gentleman and always uses the litter box.

The down side is that he is scared of other animals. He runs in terror if our other cats come within sight. He is more tolerant of our big dogs. He no longer hisses at them but takes care to walk far around them. Between the pets and kids, our busy house has turned out to be too much for him. He stays in the bathroom and refuses to come out even though the door is open. I feel terrible for him, we did not bring him out of one bathroom only to have him stuck in another.

If you have a quiet home without other pets and would like to consider giving Slinky a home, please contact me. There will be no adoption fee to the right home. Slinky will come with a bag of food, his litter box and pet wipes."

sampson needs forever home (gainesville)
Please consider adopting an older pet. There are so many great things about a senior pet. They are already housebroken. They don't chew up your furniture. They don't require a lot of exercise. They don't eat all the time. All they need is a nice bed and to follow you room to room and a couple of walks around the block to stay in shape with you. Oh and lots of love. Sampson needs a forever home to call his own. Please leave a contact number for adoption information!

She is the sweetest girl ever. Plays great with all the other rescue dogs. Shes spayed and current on shots. She's hoping someone will appreciate her for who and how great she truly is one day and to have her very own yard and home to play in. But until that time comes she will wait!

"Wanting to adopt a female, adult cat (near Mall of Ga)"
"I'm the mom of a family in search of a cat companion to join our diverse gang of characters.  There are two loving parents, a lovely pre-teen, and a cuddly 8-year old (the humans); and two family dogs, Lu and Maggie.  Lu is a big baby- easy going and loveable.  Maggie is a beagle mix that loves attention and barks a lot.  Neither dog is anything but playful.
We are thinking we'd like to adopt an adult female with *short hair* who wants to be loved on (petted, lap cat, easy going).  She needs to be litter box trained, spayed, and current on her vaccines.  We are choosing a female to avoid the 'marking of territory' that happens with male cats- but if there's a male that doesn't spray- we might be interested.
The pre-teen is the one taking on the financial responsibility for the adoptive cat.  We pay for food and sick-pet vetting, she pays the adoption fee and regular yearly vet bill for vaccines.  That is important because I know my daughter cannot afford vet bills for a special needs kitty.  Therefore, a clean bill of health will be important.
We are located in zip code 30011, and are willing to travel up to 100 miles or so.  Heck, I could see us going to Alabama, Tennessee or SC for the right adoption.  Hoping to bring home the cat this week (today is the 15th of December) so that the following two weeks (when the kids are out of school) the family can be attentive to the needs of the adjustment and help build a positive bond.  
If you know of a cat that fits the description of what we are looking for, please feel free to contact us."

Adorable Male Mini Pig for sale! (Canton)
"I have a very cute mini pig I am adopting out. He is red with black spots and about 15 lbs. He is litter box trained, friendly, leash trained, and he likes to play. If kept solely as a pet he needs to be fixed. All male mini pigs do......but if you want to breed him he couldn't get any handsomer! We have a fenced in back yard so let him go root around back there for an hour each day, let him wrestle with us, and then he cuddles up and sleeps. He sleeps alot! He would make a great Christmas gift and he is unique pet. I will provide neutering info so you can get that done if you don't want to breed. His adoption fee is $100 which is way below his value. Contact me if interested bc he will sell quick!"
puppies (ellijay)
"SERIOUSLY PEOPLE, 

You are ridiculous. $200+ for a puppy.. almost understandable IF it has papers, however clearly some of you have a very hard time reading and understanding very clear, very direct posting rules. Or English in its entirety ""Oh woe is me an ""oops"" litter let me charge $400 for each puppy and be greedy when no one is in the state to drop that much cash on a puppy, that poor thing is going to end up where all you assholes always go 1. a shelter as if they aren't over run enough or 2. drop it of on the side of the road, woods, ect. ect. I could go on with that but I'm sure you don't even really care what happens to that innocent puppy, ""pets (no animal sales or breeding -- rehoming with small adoption fee is ok -- info on free to good home ads)"" is the rule clearly stated sooo i ask seriously what in your brain says a ""small"" re-homing fee means its ok to breed these poor dogs out until they die which will happen eventually you heartless D-Bag, and charge so much money that said buyer now cant feed said puppy.... 


so With that said I'm probably better off saving a puppy from a pet store, but im choosing a shelter because your over priced puppies are more than likely gonna end up there anyways.. or dead because you don't care..."

Gentle Rush needs a home!
"This beautiful girl is Rush. She was previously a stray and I rescued her on one of the coldest nights yet. She had been sleeping on someone's porch with a blanket in 19 degree weather before we got her. She's an absolute JEWEL. She is SO obedient and will make a great pet. Rush is...
• Very obedient
• Knows how to sit, wait, and stay. 
• Walks great on leash
• House broken and crate trained (hasn't had a single accident!) 
• Very dog and kid friendly
• Very gentle and loving 
• Low/medium energy 
• Doesn't roam/runaway when off leash 
She is a little shy at first but very sweet. She would be great with laid back couple, someone who wants a larger dog that they can control, or a family that wants a relatively calmer dog. She has the perfect energy level and is seriously so sweet. She's approximately 56lbs. She should gain at least 10 additional pounds. 

Rush is located in Atlanta. In order to adopt, you'll have to submit an adoption application and possibly agree to a home check. Her adoption fee is $85 (but can be less depending on the special going on at the shelter). 

Her only con is that she is heartworm positive. This is very treatable, non-contagious, and inexpensive if done though the shelter. If needed, you can often get a sponsorship to help cover the costs. Email me back with questions or to set up a date for a meet and greet!"

!!! Sweet female  beagle/jack Russell mix needs a good home!!! (Kennesaw)
"Hello! My two Marine roomates and I were given a sweet, 8-9 yr old beagle/jack Russell mix dog by a no longer friend who refuses to take responsibility for her pet. As decent human beings, we have been taking care of and walking the dog, Aspen, daily. Our appartment complex does not allot dogs however and we all hold fairly hectic work schedules and feel Aspen would be happier with a family or a couple who knows how to care for a shy, good natured dog like her. She is incredibly sweet, excellent around kids and very shy at first, but once she warms up to you she loves to play and run around and is very well behaved. We would prefer not to put her in an adoption home if we can find the right family for her. My number is

German Shepherd needs a home (gainesville)

You may recall her story we posted a few, months ago about this beautiful girl. Her original owners kept her tied to an old car bumper and if she could get under the car then she had shelter from storms. We think she's paid her dues and good people are still out there. Shes patiently waiting as she has her whole life it seems. Please leave a contact number for adoption details!"

Scarlet Macaw for adoption (Forsyth)
"Still not completely sure if I want to give him up or not. But I figured I would go ahead and post this to gauge what kind of interest there is.

I'm not one of those long-distance scammers who will ask for shipping fees and disappear. I really am local and won't ask you for money unless I am standing right there in front of you, ready to transfer the bird. And unlike those scammers, my bird isn't ""free.... with shipping"". There IS a rehoming fee!

Peanut is a 14-year-old scarlet macaw. He is presumed to be male but I'm not certain. He is in excellent health and fully feathered. He was tamed to the point of rolling onto his back so you could pet his tummy and tickle his feet. But lately I have not had time to spend with him. I'm really hoping my situation changes back, so I can spend much more time with him. But right now I'm just rarely home.

He rarely flies, so he tires out easily when he does. He'd rather walk across the floor, following you around the house. He's a typical playful macaw who likes to hang from a single toe from the top of his cage. First time I saw it, I was scared his foot was caught!

His beak is a little rough right now, so it could use some filing. Same with his toenails. His favorite food is cooked, chilled pasta, and unsalted Peanuts (thus his name). He has a decent vocabulary and he can say Hello, I Love You, Whatever, Okay, Bye Bye, Peekaboo, and Peanut.

I do NOT keep him in a cage! The photo was taken at an exotic bird fair where I was looking at cages, but Peanut has actually NEVER been kept in a cage for as long as I have had him. He has his perch and a wooden box that he likes to sleep in sometimes. He prefers climbing to flying anyway. When he is on my shoulder, he prefers that to any cage, perch, etc. I have taken him outside many, many times, and he stays parked on my shoulder. So there is NO CAGE INCLUDED in his adoption. Adoption fee is $1100.

If you are interested in giving him a good home, please email me at the address above."
Weimaraner mix for adoption (gainesville)
"Blue was born around June 2011 and he is up to date on shots and neutered. He has been kept as an only pet. he is very playful. He just loves to play ball. Due to his strength and height we do not suggest  he be homed with small dogs, cats, or children under 12.
He would be best with a stay at parent since he likes to sit around and watch tv or go outside and play ball. He is super strong and super loving he seems to be smiling all the time. He is so full of life. If you think you would make a good parent for
Blue please leave a contact number as he is hoping that you will be perfect for him. Adoption fee applies."

Beautiful Female Beagle!!  $175 Adoption Fee (Elko)
"""Daisy"" is a cute, adorable, sociable, tender and loving two year old beagle. She makes a great family pet. She loves kids and is very energetic. She needs a fenced in yard or she will follow her nose until she gets tired! From hunting stock, purebred, but not papered. Micro-chipped, spayed, current on all shots/vaccines. Re-homing fee of $175, just covers her spay/chip/vaccines. We have fostered her since February, and we have our hands full with two other adopted pups, so she needs another GOOD home. If you plan on penning her up and ignoring her, please find another pup. She's comfortable around babies, children, cats, chickens, cattle... very socialized.  And she doesn't dig, chew, or bark (unless she's on a scent trail). Daisy is ready for a new loving family!"

Sunset Bird Sanctuary accepting unwanted pets (McDonough)
"Sunset Bird Sanctuary is taking in unwanted pet birds. Specialized care for everything from parrots to finches, and all species in between.

http://sunsetsanctuary.weebly.com

We are a LICENSED NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION. We do not BUY animals, nor do we SELL them. As a matter of fact, most animals we take in, are never adopted out. Many animals come here to find their actual ""forever"" home - a place where they can finish their natural lives in peace without being passed around any more.

VERY RARELY do we adopt animals back out. Please do not contact us looking for a new pet, because we most likely don't have any up for adoption. We have had people who needed to ""dump"" several pets at once, and couldn't wait to rehome all of them, and ask us to take them and find new homes for them. But NO animal is adopted out of here unless specifically requested by the surrendering owner.

We can rehabilitate sick and injured animals as well and give many of them a forever home right here in our facility in Henry County. We grow much of our pets' food right here on the property including mealworms, earthworms, crickets, fruits, and vegetables for a diet as close to natural as possible. Birds are given time in huge outdoor flight cages in warm weather and we have over 70 acres available to build and expand. We currently have 8 volunteers who are mostly retired or disabled people. This means all of our birds get plenty of human interaction, socialization, and love!

Rest assured that if you can no longer care for them, your pet will live out a very happy and healthy life with us.

We are also accepting donations of cages, pens, toys, and food to help us accomodate more incoming animals, and continue caring for the permanent residents here. Again, we are a licensed NON-PROFIT organization.

Our sanctuary is NOT open to the public, and we do not allow tours for biosecurity reasons. We want these animals to live in PEACE and not worry about contagious diseases affecting the entire sanctuary. All incoming animals are kept quarantined until they are given a clean bill of health. Because of this, we will gladly pick the animals up from your location, or meet you halfway.

sampson needs forever home  (gainesville)
Please consider adopting an older pet. There are so many great things about a senior pet. They are already housebroken. They don't chew up your furniture. They don't require a lot of exercise. They don't eat all the time. All they need is a nice bed and to follow you room to room and a couple of walks around the block to stay in shape with you. Oh and lots of love. Sampson needs a forever home to call his own. Please leave a contact number for adoption information!

Baby Chinchillas (Athens)
"Three baby chinchillas are up for adoption and ready to go! Would like to get them adopted by this week if possible so I'm dropping the adoption fee from $75 to $50. Adoption fee is firm to help pay for the cost of raising them for 3 months.  There are currently 2 males and 1 female. I will adopt them out as I see fit to the proper owners, though those who can pick up first will take priority. I cannot hold them unless you are willing to pay the adoption fee first, considering that I've had people ask me to hold them and then not bother to get back to me. Serious inquiries only please. Chinchillas make great pets but are not pets that should be with children unsupervised. Chinchillas have great personalities, but they are very delicate and can easily be harmed by carelessness. Chinchillas require temperatures never exceeding 80 degrees, I keep mine in a room between mid 60s to lower 70s. They do need dust baths on regular basis (can be purchased at most pet stores or online) and need room to jump and play! Please text or email for a convenient time to come meet them or for any questions. NO PHONE CALLS (I don't answer phone calls even from people I do know.)"
Lovebird (Blue Ridge)
"Up for adoption is a 3 month old lovebird. It was hand fed, not by myself. It wasn't handled much before I got it. It is a little hand shy but workable and will make a good pet with a little work. I am working with its sibling to hand tame it. It doesn't bite me. 

 No cage will be included.
 $50
 Texting is the best way to reach me. Texts after 9 pm will be answered the following morning."
German Shepherd needs a home (gainesville)
"Our girl shepherd is still hoping a family will come for her. She has been in a foster home with about 10 other dogs and she prefers to be an only pet. She is, spayed and crate trained. You may recall her story we posted a few, months ago about this beautiful girl. Her original owners kept her tied to an old car bumper and if she could get under the car then she had shelter from storms. We think she's paid her dues and good people are still out there. Shes patiently waiting as she has her whole life it seems. Please leave a contact number for adoption details!"

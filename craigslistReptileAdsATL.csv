We offer both care in YOUR home or in my home. With over 35 years of professionally handling and training dogs of all breeds, I pride myself on caring for dogs. I've shown all over the USA and won Westminster as well as owning the number 1 show dog in the country.

They become part of the family when in my home. I have a full acre and it's completely fenced and 6 ft high. Lots of play time if your dog is capable or comfy beds if they prefer to lounge. I'm close to the greenway trail system so walking is fun! I also sit other animals besides dogs. Birds, fish, reptiles. Sorry no cats. Not too far from the lake! In the summer we take trips up there and if you have a water loving dog, he'll be sure to sleep well when he goes home! The lake is fun fun fun to the water loving dogs! About this sitter: I am a licensed Vet tech who is a huge dog lover! I understand each dogs needs as well as giving shots for a diabetic dog! Have a dog that requires medication? NO PROBLEM! I'm the one you're looking for to care for your family member as you would. I can take into my home or care in yours. I'm a very active person who can also take your dogs out for walks or runs!

  VERY loving FULL/PART TIME pet sitter/walker! ANY PETS!!! (ALL METRO ATL)

        Old pets? Adolescent Pets? Pets that need special care/medication/bathing? Big pets? Little pets? Spoiled pets? Skiddish pets? Emergency pet sitter needed? Short-term sitting? Long-term sitting? One time or every week/month/year sitter, I'll answer my phone and I'm perfect for you.

Hi there! My name is Mandi. I am a young adult in her 20's that loves animals and aspires to be a veternarian or exotic animal breeder one day. I have PLENTY of references from trusted sources including, friends, family, and animal clinics. I am NOT certfied, though, yet! My mother has been a trusted pet sitter for years in the Gwinnett area. I have owned many animals during my entire life. I have always owned several cats and several dogs at once as well as several ferrets, hamsters, sugar gliders, guinea pigs, rats, mice and birds. I also have owned different types of reptiles as well as taken care of, but not limited to, snakes, beardies, frilled dragons, all geckos and lizards, etc.

I am willing to animal sit or dog walk any time of day or night. I do own a cat who isn't too fond of animals larger than her (older cats or dogs). However, I am willing to travel to your residence (within the perimeter or no more than 20 miles outside of perimeter) or if you have a caged pet (small animals, birds, reptiles, etc.) or cat/dog under 20 lbs. I would be willing to invite them in my home for the duration of your absence. I am very affordable and negotiable (and TRUSTWORTHY, most importantly). Please contact ASAP to set up plans!! Via e-mail accepted but you will get much faster response via text. 

Thank you and hope everyone is having happy holidays!

  Dog Boarding Dog Sitting TUCKER and DECATUR Pet Boarding & Sitting (Decatur, Tucker, NE Metro Atlanta)
"
"
        I am an experienced pet sitter and dog trainer.  I am a small, exclusive, personal service for small dogs.  I board a few at a time in my home which is located in the northeast area of metro Atlanta near Decatur, Tucker, Emory, North Druid Hills Road, Lawrenceville Highway and  Northlake.  I am fairly close to 285/85 in the 30033 zip code.  Are you going away for business or vacation and need someone to pamper and spoil your dog just like you would when you are there?  I am able to take a few small to medium well behaved dogs up to 30 pounds into my pet friendly home.      

No dog wants to go to some impersonal facility with concrete floors and stay in a cage for hours every day.  In my care, your dogs would be able to run around the house and make themselves at home.  There is a doggie door out to a fenced, park-like area and I have lots of toys and clean pet beds.  All you have to bring is their food and any special things they like.  The types of dogs that I usually take are small to medium dogs like Maltese, Shih tzu, Yorkies, Cavaliers, Chihuahuas, Poodles, Havanese, Dachunds, Boston Bulldogs, Schnauzers and small to medium mixed breeds.  I will consider any dog up to 30 pounds who is well behaved and mannerly.  I must protect all the dogs who come here, so, I can only take the best behaved dogs.

I can also come to your home to care for any of your birds, cats, fish, etc., while you are away.  I can play with them and give them some company so they won't feel alone while you are gone.       

The best way to reach me is by calling and asking for Rose at 770-837-2two07 or answer this ad through Craigslist.  I'm sorry but I don't text.  The first introductory appointment is FREE to bring your dog to meet me at my home for boarding or to come to your house to meet your cats, birds or fish.  

I provide the best pet care experience possible in a home environment.  I also have three years experience in dog training.  My rates for boarding small dogs in my home are based on the care required for your particular dog and generally start at $25-$30 per day for one dog with a smaller fee of $10 for the second in the same family.    

My service is the best alternative to decrease anxiety in your pets while you are gone.  Let's face it, they love you the most and don't want to be without you.  But, if you must be away, they still need and crave that love and attention they are used to getting from you.  In my care, they would get lots of lap time, back and belly rubs, ear scratches and someone who will take the time to play with them.  I try to accommodate their usual schedule and let them sleep where they are used to sleeping.  The dogs who come here get to know each other over time.  Once they get used to coming here, they feel like they are going over to their aunt's house to play with their cousins.  

My dog is a Maltipoo that I rescued a few months ago.  She loves all the dogs who come here.  We have a great yard and neighborhood for walks.  I am home 95% of the time.  I keep them safe, healthy and happy.  Your first introductory appointment is FREE.  If you would like an estimate for your trip, don't text, call Rose at 770-837-220seven or just respond to this ad.

Notaquitter-- Super Handsome Thoroughbred Gelding for Sale - $4500 (Woodstock)
"Nico is a lovely Thoroughbred gelding looking for a new home.  He's been off the track for several years and has had a beautiful start to his civilian career. 

Nico is eight years old and stands an impressive 17 hands tall.  He's a big framed guy with great bone and a powerful build. He has sound, clean legs and absolutely no limitations.  The world is truly his oyster.  He should be able to do anything! 

Nico works well in the ring at all three gaits.  He's a lovely mover with a soft and easy way of going.  He works in a dee ring snaffle, and is comfortably ridden in both a close contact and dressage saddle. 

Nico loves attention and definitely enjoys a good grooming.  He's easy to handle and has no vices.  This lovely horse is a pleasure to have in the barn and is only for sale because his owner has downsized to a smaller horse (who's more suitable to her 5'4"" height).

For more information about Nico and other horses for sale at A Pinch of Luck, please visit our website at www.apinchofluck.com.  Feel free to send an email or call

Awesome Mich-- Awesome Thoroughbred Gelding for Sale - $2700 (Woodstock)
"His name sums him up! Awesome Mich is truly awesome.  He is the ultimate definition of horse racing's ""War Horse."" He ran 74 times in a career that spanned six years, and retired with just shy of a quarter million dollars in earnings. Mich is eight years old and stand at an impressive 16.1 hands tall. 

This kind, sweet gentlemen is adjusting well to life off the track and away from everything he knows.  He's learning about not going to work every day, what turn out is, and how it feels to be groomed for no reason other that a good grooming.  Mich is so kind and truly appreciates everything we do with him. 

Mich loves to be ridden and has been a total gentleman under saddle since ride one off the track.  He works beautifully at all three gaits and carries himself beautifully in a very nice frame.  Everyone who meets this guy adores him. So many from the track know him and speak of his generous nature. 

Mich is wonderful to work with and relishes attention.  He has beautiful manners and can be ridden by just about anyone with a little experience.  He'd be a great horse for a young rider working with a trainer or an adult seeing a partner of their own. He's a gentleman for the farrier and loves grooming. Mich occasionally will crib on his door frame if he feels he's missing out on attention, treats, 
or food. 

We love this horse and are truly honored to be a part of his transition from racing to civilian life. He retired from the track sound and with only negligible wear and tear.  He's ready and willing to go in any direction and would love a home and career that will afford him a more laid back lifestyle than the one he's left behind.

It's Goodtobeking-- Striking 17.1 Hand Thoroughbred Gelding for Sale - $3500 (Woodstock)
"Handsome and tall, Toby is a nine year old gelding who is just waiting for a person of his own.  This good looking horse left racing after eighty starts and with earnings just shy of $100,000.  At 17.1 hands he is a true testament to the longevity that correct conformation brings. 

Toby has been with us since mid November and is very lightly restarted.  He has lovely floating gaits. It's easy to imagine him in the show ring or galloping cross country.  He's shown himself to be kind and willing under saddle, and already has a history of trail riding and giving pony rides during his winter vacations from the race track.   Because of his size,  Toby is best suited to a serious, experienced rider looking for an intelligent and athletically talented new partner. 

Toby retired from the track with sound, clean legs.  He is great for the farrier, clearly enjoys grooming, and is great to work with on the ground.  He has impeccable manners, no vices, and is a joy to have in the barn. 

Toby is offered for sale at a reduced asking price to help him find his new person before Christmas.  For more information about him and other horses for sale at A Pinch of Luck, please visit our website at www.apinchofluck. com. Feel free to email or call directly at

Qu-- Adorable and Fun Thoroughbred Gelding for Sale - $1500 (Woodstock)
"Price reduced to help him find a home before Christmas! 

Qu is an adorable and fun 16 hand Thoroughbred gelding.  He's five years old, and after a short, four race career on the track, he's ready for a new job and a person of his own. 

Qu had been lightly restarted since leaving the track in September.  He willingly walks, trots, and takes both canter leads.  He's extremely intelligent and sponges up his lessons.  At this time, he's best suited for a rider comfortable with a forward horse -- there is not a mean or naughty bone in him, but he loves to work and shows it in his eagerness to carry out his rider's requests. 

Qu is sound with clean legs and no vices.  He had a stall accident in the spring that had left him with scar tissue to the cornet band and hoof wall on a hind hoof. It is growing out nicely, and affects him only cosmetically.  He loves attention and enjoys grooming.  Well behaved for the farrier and easy to handle, Qu has the makings of a wonderful, all around horse who truly can do anything!

Barefoot Hoof Care Specialist - $40 (United States)
"Barefoot hoof care specialist with over 12 years in the field. Very experienced in rehab of founder, navicular, and transitioning from shod to bare. I trim horses in most every discipline, at every stage of their life.  I have trained with Cindy Sullivan, Pete Ramey, Jaime Jackson, and several other preeminent people in the field of natural horse care.  I approach trimming with the whole horse approach.  Balanced trimming, attention to diet, movement, tack, rider balance and environment (and more) are crucial for full horse health and hoof function.

Trimming is $40 per regular sized horse, $20 for small ponies or minis, and I'm sorry, but I no longer trim drafts.  Service area is primarily in Coweta and adjoining counties.  No charge for pulling shoes. I am an authorized EasyCare dealer, I carry fit kits with me, and will be happy to work with you to find the right size and style boot for your horse.

Listing Price is $1949/ Stores price around $1749.  This saddle has a key that reduces or expands the size of the Tree to fit ANY horse!

Includes Cover, Tree Adjustment Key with Intec warranty, a bottle of leather Cleaner and a bottle of leather Conditioner.  

      From Intec ""M.Toulouse"": ""We have added the new Genesis adjustable tree to our best selling Annice model. As with all M. Toulouse saddles the Annice Genesis is hand crafted of natural, tanned, pigmented, aniline-finished high-quality leather which will accept oil.

     The innovative Genesis adjustable gullet system allows a single saddle to custom fit all your horses--safely and dependably--because Genesis is the only adjustable gullet system that gives you every saddle width needed and it locks.

     Whether you ride several horses, or your horse is growing and changing, the Genesis gullet system will adjust your saddle from narrow to extra-wide and any width in between--millimeter by millimeter.
 
     With its integral parts constructed of case-hardened steel, the Genesis is also the only adjustable gullet system backed by a 10-year guarantee. We stand so firmly behind our design, materials and craftsmanship that we promise you at least a decade of use with your Genesis adjustable--and locking--gullet system. You must register your saddle online.
 
     Adjustments to the Genesis system are made quickly and easily in three steps using the included tools: unlock the gullet; adjust the gullet width and lock in the new width. All your adjustments are made almost instantly and without taking the saddle apart. A small, discrete flap underneath the saddle is all you need to open. And you can adjust your Genesis gullet as often as you need for every horse you ride. For more information http://intecperformancegear.com/genesis_system.php

     The Annice saddle is comparable to an Antares saddle.(Product names, logos, brand names, trademarks and service marks featured in or referred to on this site are the property of their respective owners. No endorsement by or affiliation with those owners is intended or implied.)"""

"Horse for Sale - $800 (CUMMING, GA)"
"I have a really nice little filly for sale, I have gotten too many horses and just don't have the time to finish her. She is super easy to get along with, catch anywhere, clip, has been started on riding, my little girl who is a confident 11 year old has ridden her, she is not spooky, and just needs some wet saddle blankets.. She is a coming 3 year old half twh half standardbred, she is not gaiting at this point, would be a great walk trot canter English horse, she is only 14 hands and reminds me of a Hackney pony without all the action, she is a pet and loves attention... She is green as far as guiding and exposure, but has never offered to buck, bite, kick, bolt, rear or anything.. I have too many and need to reduce my herd, she would be a good kids horse with very little riding.. Willing to trade for anything that doesnt eat.."
SSH Mare - $500
"Beautiful Double Registered Spotted Saddle horse mare. 
Please read my post before you call with questions. 
She needs a good loving home where she can stay the rest of her life. She is 10 years old (April 3rd, 2004)  She is out of ""The Budweiser Bandit"" and ""Cherokee's Goody-4-Shoes"". I am pricing her for 500.00. I have well over 2500 in her. I am getting older and I have 3 horses counting her that I do not ride. She was the last here and will be the first to go.
Must have pictures of your farm and where she will be staying. You must OWN your property, have a vet reference. A contact will be drawn and I will want to come check on her once in a while. Would like to keep her as close to home as possible in case it doesn't work out.
I just had the ferrier out and her feet have been trimmed. Two of my horses have White Line, She has White Line in both front feet that he cut away and should heal just fine with someone doctoring it regularly. SHE IS NOT LAME. I do not want to deal with two horses with it so her price is greatly reduced for this issue. 
She is broke to ride. She is very soft in the mouth and has great flexibility. Be ready to stop when you ask her to stop or you will go over her head.  She likes to be with her pasture buddy when she rides. She will follow all day long, cross creeks, rivers, and bridges behind her buddy. I would trust her with an inexperienced rider as long as she is following her buddy. She will ride alone, does not get crazy but she is anxious and looks for her buddy. She has NEVER bucked, reared, kicked or bit anyone or even another horse for that matter. I have not ridden her in over a year but would not hesitate to get on her and go. I just don't have time and there is only one of me and three of them. She is gentle, gets along with cows, goats, pigs, etc. . . She doesn't argue about her place with the herd.
Current coggins, She is about 14.3 hds, pretty easy to keep on just pasture and hay. She has never gotten really fat on pasture. She's good with the Ferrier and will load in my 3 horse slant with no issues. (Not sure about a smaller trailer.)
She is sometimes hard to catch but only because my other horse gets her started and she follows suit. With some one on one she would be a great horse for someone.

Please contact me by phone. I will answer a few texts but I'm not going to get into long drawn out texts."

Sweet Quarter Horse for Partial Lease - $275 (Canton)
"Very sweet, approx 15.3 hand quarter horse that is located in Canton, GA, and is close to Alpharetta and Cumming, GA.  She is suitable for a beginner.  Calm, eager to please and works weekly with a trainer.  She has been training weekly for my 7 year old to ride.  She is suitable for pleasure/trail riding and the farm she is at has both a riding ring and trails. 

We unfortunately have not been able to get out to the farm as much as we like these days, which is  why I am exploring a partial lease.    

Quality/affordable riding lessons are also available from our trainer for $45/lesson. Trainer will also do 30 min lessons for reduced amount.

This lease would require her to stay at the farm.  They take awesome care of their horses and welcome all disciplines and maintain a very laid back, friendly environment.

Ideal lessee would be a young adult or adult who loves horses, has always wanted to have a horse and is now at a point in their life that they can dedicate the time to going out to the farm.

Please email for additional details, and we are willing to tailor a lease to individual situations.  Lease ranges will likely be $250-$350 depending on amount of riding/situation. Will require in person meeting before lease agreed.  We want to make sure this is the right fit for anyone interested.

Thanks for viewing!

16hh horse - $1500 (Douglasville)
"I have a beautiful 16 hh  10yr old Bay Thoroughbred horse, for sale $1500 I will take payments of $100 a month from the right person, if you need tack I will sell the saddle, bridle, brushes, blanket and everything else you need for a horse for an additional $500. The saddle is worth $700 alone.

Video's of her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojNm7Ld1vUQ&feature=youtu.be

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-O-3O-My2M

Currently she is boarded in Douglasville , the board is $180/month they supply the hay and feed your grain 2x a day ...the barn is open for horses to come and go as they please, she does have her own stall.

She is not a beginner horse, but great for someone who knows how to ride intermediate, she used to be on the racetrack so can be fast, she loves to run. I have jumped her over some small jumps, taken her across Kenesaw mountain, ridden her along busy roads... however she has been in the pasture for the last year and not ridden much. I have gone several months without riding her and just jumped on her and she has been fine.... I ride her English but she has gone Western also, she is a beautiful mover, and very flashy, would be a great show horse. Her confirmation is awesome. I have taught children to ride on her but only when she was ridden consistently. 
She walks, halts, backs, canters and gallops well and you don't need to work too hard to get her to do what you want.

Currently she gets fed 2 scoops of feed a day

I would also lease her for $200 a month if she is left at the same barn with option to buy, this would be a great Christmas present for someone. ONLY to a good home!!! Serious buyer or Lessee only."

PAINT GELDING FOR SALE - $1500 (THOMASTON)
"This guy is young, bold and brave. He's been around tractors, backhoes, four wheelers, golfcarts, and nearly any other type of vehicle and the goofy guy just wants to chase them. He just finished 30 days training back in July with Trey Anderson out of Lizella, GA. He's got loads of potential and tons of character. He's patient with kids and he's lazy. Once he's been lunged (and he needs to be lunged before being ridden) he's perfectly content walking. He's got a fast gallop and could probably make a great kid's barrel horse if trained to the barrels. He's an exceptional trail horse and I take him out for rides on back roads. He does well riding with other horses and is a very social horse.

This is not some back country horse that has been ill trained or ill mannered. I've trained him with Natural Horsemanship for as long as I've had him. He is not, however, a horse to leave a kid who has no experience riding unsupervised on.

Come out and see him, you won't be disappointed.

He's roughly 56"" at his withers and will probably fill out more in his shoulders throughout next year.
He trailers extremely well and will climb up in a small trailer. Stands well for farrier, grooming, ect. I bought him when he was 7 months old off a guy who didn't know much about him, except he is not papered.

This guy has the potential to go places, whether you're just looking for a trail horse or an eventer.

I'm not in any rush to sell, but I'd be willing to work with you. I want him to go to a good home where he'll be put to work."

"Choice of 2 Horses for Lease - $140 (Taylorsville, just West of Cartersville)"
"I'm now offering two horses for lease at my facility. 

Palomino mare, Platinum, has been worked with extensively over the past year and a half, she'd never been handled much and absolutely no love given to her before now. She's an excellent horse, rides English or western in my arena or out on trails. She isn't a dead head, on the scale of temperament: 1-10 (1 being totally dead head......10 being hot) she's about a 4.

Arabian mare, Sugar, the description above applies to this sweet horse too.

They've been leased for the past year and a half and have done so great and now are well rounded horses all around."
Brand New Voltaire Design Palm Beach Saddle - $4400 (sandy springs)
"For sale is a brand new 18"" Voltaire Design Palm Beach saddle. 
Purchased new for about $6,000, but unfortunately never got the chance to use it.
This is a great saddle that would make someone very happy.
Top of line from a well-known French manufacturer of high quality saddles.
Included with the saddle are the Stirrups, Stirrup Leathers and the Voltaire Design bag that contains Voltaire Design's Hercules Leather Balsam and their Hercules Glycerine Soap.
This is a great deal for someone who is looking for a spectacular saddle.
Priced well below retail value

Voltaire Design description of the Saddle:

The Palm Beach saddle is a wide and half deep-seated saddle.
The Palm Beach is designed to:
* improve the rider position
* ensure high level of comfort

Our engineering team worked with trainers to understand the most common issues facing riders and to find the best way to address them. The result is an innovative saddle that keeps the rider in the correct position, maintaining the leg in the right position without restricting it.

The Second Skin option,
an exclusive design feature from Voltaire Design: Giving close-contact a whole new meaning!
The new second-skin option came from the simple idea of minimizing the amount of leather between rider and horse to achieve the closest possible contact! 
The underflap is specially treated to be softer and thinner resulting in a super light close-contact saddle.
Read our riders Club' interviews on this website; we've had so much amazing feedback about the second-skin option from top riders and trainers! The one thing we always hear about our ""second-skin"" saddles is that horses truly seem happy with their saddles and move more freely... and that's what we love to hear!
The Palm Beach saddle was also specially designed for riders who feel discomfort while riding.

"PRICE REDUCED $7950!
2000 Featherlite 9407 2 Horse Bumper Pull

This trailer is ready to hook up and go with BRAND NEW tires! 

The Featherlite name is one that is well known for their superior quality, light weight aluminum horse trailers. This floor plan is perfect for both the active competitor, and the weekend trail rider. The divider is completely removable in the event that you want to make this a box trailer to haul something other than your horses, or even lay down a mattress for an overnight! 

The trailer is 7'3"" tall, giving your larger breeds plenty of head room. If you worry about getting stuck in your trailer with your horse, this floor plan allows you to walk straight through when you load, whether you load one or two horses. If you have a timid horse, this trailer is inviting and airy. 

When you're ready to pack up and head to the show, there are two adjustable saddle racks under the mangers in the tack area, a hanging rack for your show clothes and garments, a brush box to stow away your papers and hoof picks that always seem to get lost, and LOTS of hooks for all of your bridles, halters, reins, ropes, etc. There's even a light in the dressing room to make late night trailer packing easier. 

For horsey comforts - there are two, two way vents, one over each horse head, and sliding windows all around for ventilation, and drop down windows at the head. The floors and walls are covered in sturdy rubber, with extra padding on the area against your horse's chest.

2015 Polaris® RZR® XP 1000 EPS Havasu Red Pearl
Power Features
999CC PROSTAR EFI ENGINE
Designed specifically for extreme performance, the Polaris ProStar 1000 engine features 999ccs of big bore twin displacement and all of the hallmark ProStar features. This includes dual overhead cams, electronic fuel injection, and 4 valves per cylinder. It also features 48MM throttle bodies and long-tip fuel injectors giving the 2015 RZR XP 1000 instant throttle response, quick to rev characteristics, and the highest horsepower in the sport SxS market.

110 HP PROSTAR 1000 H.O.
For 2015 we wanted even more power and torque! So we tweaked the cams, installed bigger valve springs, raised the compression and optimized the fuel map to give you 110 horses of High Output power. Dual overhead cams (DOHC) actuate four-oversized valves per cylinder, slamming a huge fuel charge into the combustion chambers of the engine for maximum performance.

HIGH-FLOW CLUTCH INTAKE SYSTEM
We've completely re-designed the clutch cover, secondary helix and ducting system to offer the most durable clutch system ever on the RZR XP 1000. New ducting provides twice as much airflow and decreasing belt temperature by over 50 degrees.

Suspension Features
NEAR BOTTOMLESS FEEL WITH EXCLUSIVE WALKER EVANS SHOCKS
Industry-exclusive Walker Evans needle shocks deliver next level performance and tuning capabilities. Aside from the ingenious anti-bottom needle technology, the 2.5-inch diameter rear shocks feature tool-less 16-position compression dampening control, allowing you to tune for the perfect ride for any condition.

THE MOST ADVANCED SUSPENSION FOR MOST CONTROL AND SMOOTHEST RIDE
The race-inspired 3-link trailing arm rear suspension serves up an incredible 18-inches of rear wheel travel. Matched to an astounding 16-inches of front suspension travel and 13.5-inches of ground clearance, the king of the RZR family conquers the worst terrain Mother Nature has to offer.

LONG TRAVEL DUAL A-ARM INDEPENDENT FRONT SUSPENSION
The dual A-arm front suspension on the RZR XP 1000 delivers a plush 16-inches of travel and features a dual coil-over spring design. By using two individual springs and a crossover point versus a single dual rate spring, the RZR XP 1000 delivers a smooth, precise ride no matter the terrain.

Agility Features
HIGH PERFORMANCE ON DEMAND ALL-WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM
The On-Demand True All-Wheel Drive System is revamped with an 80 percent improvement in strength over the standard system. The result is the most durable front drive system ever found on a RZR. The system features close ratio final drive to keep the front wheels pulling stronger and longer maximizing power delivery to the ground on even the loosest terrain. The reduction provides increased traction without sacrificing steering effort to provide unmatched point-and-shoot handling.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED SUSPENSION GEOMETRY
A race-inspired 3-link rear suspension maximizes acceleration, sharpens control, and improves straight-line tracking by keeping the tires in contact with the ground more often. Polaris redesigned the already best-in-class 3-link suspension introduced in 2011 with revised geometry to offer 25% more ground clearance from leading edge of tire in regards to the trailering arm; optimized camber gain for improved traction; and a longer trailing arm for added strength.

STANDARD ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING
Revised front suspension geometry and standard Electronic Power Steering (EPS) results in less steering effort and delivers the ultimate in control with reduced rider fatigue.

ASK FOR SALES"
5 y/o Andalusian mare - $12000 (social circle)
"Up for sale is a beautiful 5 y/o andalusian mare. She stands 15.2 hands and still growing. Both her parents were over 16 hands. She has 90 days training on her but requires an experienced rider. She is very spirited and full of life. She is IALHA registered. Unfortunately I have other horses that need attention as well and with a busy work schedule it is hard to focus on everyone:( She needs a single owner that will love her and focus on her. Only approved home only. I am not in a rush to sell so only serious inquiries answers. 

Will consider a partial trade of bomb-proof well trained larger horse as partial payment. 

Thank you"

Rider Available  (Gainesville & Surrounding)
"Versatile adult rider with over twenty years of horse experience looking for a few regular exercise clients. English or Western. Soft hands, light seat. Let me put miles on your horse or help fit up a sales prospect. Greenies and seasoned troopers alike are welcome. Can do trails, pasture, or arena work. 

Horses that are currently under saddle command a higher sales price than those that have had 'a few months off'. I can help keep your newly started horse consistent or help your retiree limber up during the cold. Or, let me keep your show horse in shape through the winter so that when the season starts you can hop on and go! 

Reliable, no drama, non-smoker. Experienced with all breeds, genders, and sizes. Small enough to ride the ponies too. 

Currently offering weekends and evenings (if lights are available), but if enough people are interested, weekday slots will be added on. 

Must be within a 30 minute drive of zip code 30506. Outside areas will be considered, with additional charges for mileage. 

$50 for one horse on a ride by ride basis.

$40 per horse for locations with multiple horses. Minimum two rides per visit for the discount to apply. 

Discounted pre-paid monthly packages are available. 

Ride prices accommodate for a quick clean-up/tack up/cool down/and un-tacking along with thirty minutes to an hour of ride time, depending on the horse and the situation. If a horse is difficult to catch, filthy, requires lunging prior to riding, etc. prices will be adjusted to account for additional time. I never rush to fit into a time constraint, it reduces effective riding. 

Tack must be provided. I do have a saddle, but it may not fit your horse properly. 

Also available to prep for shows, ride for sales videos/potential buyers, ride off site, and catch ride for classes. Eligible everything. Bathing, tack cleaning, feeding, farm sitting, stalls, grooming, etc. are all options. Prices can be negotiated as the need arises. 

I am happy to answer questions. References are available upon request, but I prefer to speak for myself. New clients are offered a free test ride for evaluation purposes. 

***Please Note*** I no longer own my own farm and therefore no longer start horses under saddle. That is not a part time job. To be done correctly, it requires daily attention which is not available under my current schedule. Horses MUST have had, at minimum, thirty consistent days under saddle to be eligible for 'exercise' riding."

NEEDS TO GO has been sitting around for at least 2 years doing nothing. Price has been reduced TWICE but I'm willing to negotiate a little if needed.

History:
I used this saddle for maybe a year and a half and I bought it new off of ebay. I'm selling it for no fault of its own, it just isn't what I need any longer. That saddle has been sitting ever since I purchased my newest saddle and needs to go! I've been told this would be a great saddle for an eventer because apparently you can use it in all three events (Arena jumping, cross country, and dressage), I'm not sure how true this is but that's what I was told.

NOTE: The best way to get in touch with me is to EMAIL, I rarely ever pick up my phone if I don't know the number due to the number of telemarketers I've had call me lately. Thank you!
